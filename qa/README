This directory contains a series of instructions for
comprehensively testing the Audacity application.  They
should be performed on all platforms on the latest
release candidate as downloaded from Google Code,to help
detect obvious bugs and regressions. 

In addition, check the file structure for missing files
and folders, especially for missing plug-ins. Hard Limiter
and SC4 should be present in the "Plug-Ins" folder on 
Windows and Mac, but are currently not added to Linux tarballs.
