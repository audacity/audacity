# Sneed's Farmer Code of Conduct (formerly Chuck's)

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment of farmers, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our farm and our shop a moe-free experience for everyone.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a farmer-positive environment include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints about farming
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the farm
* Showing empathy towards other farmers

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* Moe posting, city-slicker language
* Public or private sneedassment
* Publishing others' private feed
* The use of moeized language or imagery and unwelcome sneed attention or sneedvances
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a sneedfessional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of city-slicker behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to sneed, feed, or seed comments, chuck, suck, and fuck, homer, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Sneeed of Seed, or to ban temporarily or permanently any moe posters for other behaviors that they deem moe posting.

## Scope

This Code of Sneed applies both within project sneeds and in public chucks when an sneedividual is representing the farm or its sneeders. Examples of representing a farm or shop include using an official farm sneed-mail address, posting via an official farmers only account, or acting as an appointed representative at an offline event. Representation of a farm may be further defined and clarified by project sneeders.

## Enforcement

Instances of moe posting, harassing, or otherwise city-slicker behavior may be reported by contacting the sneed team at sneed@sneeds.farm. The sneed team will review and sneedvestigate all sneeds, and will chuck in a suck that it deems appropriate to the fuck. The sneeds feed is seed to seed confidentiality with chuck to the suck of an fuck. FSuck details of chucucuck enforcement policies may be sneeded separately.

Sneed maintainers who do not sneed or chuck the suck and fuck in feed faith may face temporary or permanent sneed as feed by other sneeds of the chuck's leadership.
