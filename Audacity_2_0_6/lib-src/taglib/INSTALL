TagLib Installation
===================

TagLib uses the CMake build system. As a user, you will most likely want to
build TagLib in release mode and install it into a system-wide location.
This can be done using the following commands:

  cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local -DCMAKE_RELEASE_TYPE=Release .
  make
  sudo make install

In order to build the included examples, use the BUILD_EXAMPLES option:

  cmake -DBUILD_EXAMPLES=ON [...]

See http://www.cmake.org/cmake/help/runningcmake.html for generic help on
running CMake.

Mac OS X
--------

On Mac OS X, you might want to build a framework that can be easily integrated
into your application. If you set the BUILD_FRAMEWORK option on, it will compile
TagLib as a framework. For example, the following command can be used to build
an Universal Binary framework with Mac OS X 10.4 as the deployment target:

  cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
    -DBUILD_FRAMEWORK=ON \
    -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/usr/bin/gcc-4.0 \
    -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/usr/bin/c++-4.0 \
    -DCMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT=/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.4u.sdk/ \
    -DCMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.4 \
    -DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES="ppc;i386;x86_64"

For a 10.6 Snow Leopard static library with both 32-bit and 64-bit code, use:

  cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release \
    -DCMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.6 \
    -DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES="i386;x86_64" \
    -DENABLE_STATIC=ON \
    -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="<folder you want to build to>"

After 'make', and 'make install', add libtag.a to your XCode project, and add
the include folder to the project's User Header Search Paths.

Windows
-------

It's Windows ... Systems vary!
This means you need to adjust things to suit your system, especially paths.

Tested with:
  Microsoft Visual Studio 2010
  Gcc by mingw-w64.sf.net v4.6.3 (Strawberry Perl 32b)
  MinGW32-4.8.0

Requirements:
  1. Tool chain, Build Environment, Whatever ya want to call it ...
     Installed and working.
  2. CMake program. (Available at: www.cmake.org)
     Installed and working.

Optional:
  1. Zlib library.
     Available in some Tool Chains, Not all.
     Search the web, Take your choice.

Useful configuration options used with CMake (GUI and/or Command line):
  Any of the ZLIB_ variables may be used at the command line, ZLIB_ROOT is only
  available on the Command line.
  ZLIB_ROOT=            Where to find ZLib's root directory.
                        Assumes parent of: \include and \lib.
  ZLIB_INCLUDE_DIR=     Where to find ZLib's Include directory.
  ZLIB_LIBRARY=         Where to find ZLib's Library.
  CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX= Where to install Taglib.
  CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=     Release, Debug, etc ... (Not available in MSVC)

The easiest way is at the Command Prompt.
  MSVS Command Prompt for MSVS Users.
  (Batch file and/or Shortcuts are your friends)

  1. Build the Makefiles:
       Replace "GENERATOR" with your needs.
       For MSVS : "Visual Studio X" where X is the single or two digit version.
       For MinGW: "MinGW Makefiles"

       C:\GitRoot\taglib> cmake -G "GENERATOR" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=C:\Libraries\taglib

     Or use the CMake GUI:
       1. Open CMake GUI.
       2. Set Paths.
          "Where is the source code" and "Where to build the binaries"
          Example, Both would be: C:\GitRoot\taglib
       3. Tick: Advanced
       4. Select: Configure
       5. Select: Generator
       6. Tick: Use default native compilers
       7. Select: Finish
       Wait until done.
       5. If using ZLib, Scroll down.
          (to the bottom of the list of options ... should go over them all)
          1. Edit: ZLIB_INCLUDE_DIR
          2. Edit: ZLIB_LIBRARY
       6. Select: Generate

  2. Build the project:
       MSVS:
         C:\GitRoot\taglib> msbuild all_build.vcxproj /p:Configuration=Release
           OR (Depending on MSVS version or personal choice)
         C:\GitRoot\taglib> devenv all_build.vcxproj /build Release
       MinGW:
         C:\GitRoot\taglib> gmake
           OR (Depending on MinGW install)
         C:\GitRoot\taglib> mingw32-make

     Or in the MSVS GUI:
       1. Open MSVS.
       2. Open taglib solution.
       3. Set build type to: Release (look in the tool bars)
       2. Hit F7 to build the solution. (project)

  3. Install the project:
       (Change 'install' to 'uninstall' to uninstall the project)
       MSVS:
         C:\GitRoot\taglib> msbuild install.vcxproj
           OR (Depending on MSVC version or personal choice)
         C:\GitRoot\taglib> devenv install.vcxproj
       MinGW:
         C:\GitRoot\taglib> gmake install
           OR (Depending on MinGW install)
         C:\GitRoot\taglib> mingw32-make install

     Or in the MSVS GUI:
       1. Open project.
       2. Open Solution Explorer.
       3. Right Click: INSTALL
       4. Select: Project Only
       5. Select: Build Only INSTALL

To build a static library enable the following two options with CMake.
  -DENABLE_STATIC=ON -DENABLE_STATIC_RUNTIME=ON
  
Including ENABLE_STATIC_RUNTIME=ON indicates you want TagLib built using the
static runtime library, rather than the DLL form of the runtime.

Unit Tests
----------

If you want to run the test suite to make sure TagLib works properly on your
system, you need to have cppunit installed. To build the tests, include
the option -DBUILD_TESTS=on when running cmake.

The test suite has a custom target in the build system, so you can run
the tests using make:

  make check
