Usage: 
% acconfig 

Options:
  --help     Print this message
  --version  Show version information

Purpose:
This utility parses aclocal.m4 and creates an appropriate acconfig.h.
In your m4 files put the following lines:
  dnl ACCONFIG [BOTTOM | TOP | TEMPLATE]  
  dnl .....
  dnl END ACCONFIG
Everything that appears in ... will be included in acconfig.h
The parameter [bottom|top|template] determines where in acconfig.h
the enclosed text is meant to appear.
