Instructions for building on Windows.

Fuller instructions that include
   * Installing CMake 
   * Portable Settings
   * Building an Installer
can be found on our wiki at http://wiki.audacityteam.org/wiki/Building_On_Windows


1. MSVC 2019: Download and install Microsoft Visual Studio 2019

 https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Community&rel=16

2. Git: Download and install Git, for example by installing:

  Git for Windows: https://git-scm.com/download/win
  and optionally GitExtensions: http://gitextensions.github.io/

 download and run the .msi installer.  GitExtensions has a GUI interface, includes Git for
 Windows and has a Git bash command line in the bottom panel of the screen.

3. Python
  We currently depend on Python 2.7.18 during the build.  We are working on a switch to a Python 3.
  At the time of writing, Python 2.7.18 must be on your path.

4. wxWidgets:

 1) Clone wxWidgets and checkout 3.1.3 from the Audacity fork of the 
    wxWidgets project: 
       https://github.com/audacity/wxWidgets/

    for example, in the git-bash command line
      mkdir ./wxWidgets
      cd ./wxWidgets
      git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/audacity/wxWidgets/
      
    IF you forgot the --recurse-submodules, you can correct that later by:
      git submodule update --init

  2) Follow instructions for building at 
    https://github.com/audacity/wxWidgets/blob/audacity-fixes-3.1.3/README-GIT.md
    https://github.com/audacity/wxWidgets/blob/audacity-fixes-3.1.3/docs/msw/install.md

    We (currently) build the 32 bit DLL version, 
    and Audacity is built 32 bit too.

    Set WXWIN environment variable to the appropriate directory where you installed 
    wxWidgets. This will tell CMake where to find wxWidgets later.

    To set WXWIN, click on Settings (the cogwheel icon from the start menu)
    Then in the 'find settings' search box type 'env'.
    Choose 'Edit the system environment variables'
    Then the 'Environment Variables' button 
    Then in system variables, for variable and value,  add (for example)     
        WXWIN         C:\wxWidgets-3.1.3

    You will be building a dll version with MSVC2019 IDE, so...

    In MSVC 2019 open wx_vc15.sln, and select dll, release.
    Then build.

  3) Having got this far, it is well worth trying out building some wxWidgets
    examples to confirm that building has worked OK

5. Audacity

 1) Clone Audacity from the Audacity GitHub project.
       https://github.com/audacity/audacity/

    for example, in the git-bash command line
      mkdir ./audacity
      cd ./audacity
      git clone https://github.com/audacity/audacity/

    Audacity itself does not use/need git submodules.

  2) Open the CMake GUI
    - Open VS 2019 > "continue without code" > File > Open > CMake
    - Pick CMakeLists.txt in root of audacity source folder you cloned
    - Click "Open the CMake Settings Editor"

  4) Check "Show advanced variables", click "Show advanced settings"
  5) Set CMake Settings:
    - configuration type > Release
    - toolset > msvc_x86_x86 or msvc_x86_x64
    - CMake generator > VS 16 2019

  6) Set CMake variables:
    - wxWidgets_LIB_DIR > 'C:/wxWidgets/lib/vc_dll' (your path may be slightly different)
    - CMAKE_BINARY_DIR > `${projectDir}\out\install\${name}` (default, you can change it)

  7) Save (should automatically generate CMake file)
    - if it doesn't, Project > Generate CMake Cache

  8) Build > Build All

    Check the output directory indicated in step 6 to find `Audacity.exe`
    

 Old VS 2017 instructions: 

 2) Open the CMake GUI.

     Set the 'Where is the source code' location to where your copy of the git repo is.
     Set the 'Where to build the binaries' to where you want the results.

 3) Click on Generate.

 4) Click on Open Project.

    From here on you should be able to use the project.

 5)
    Choose Release or Debug.
    Click compile.
