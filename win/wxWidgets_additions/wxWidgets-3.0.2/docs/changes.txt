                             wxWidgets Change Log
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES SINCE 2.8.x
================================


        Notice that these changes are described in more details in
        the "Changes Since wxWidgets 2.8" section of the manual,
        please read it if the explanation here is too cryptic.

Table of contents of this section:

 - Unicode-related changes
 - wxODBC and contrib libraries removal
 - Changes in behaviour not resulting in compilation errors
 - Build system changes
 - Major new features in this release


Unicode-related changes
-----------------------

The biggest changes in wxWidgets 3.0 are the changes due to the merge of the
old ANSI and Unicode build modes in a single build. See the Unicode overview
in the manual for more details but here are the most important incompatible
changes:

- Many wxWidgets functions taking "const wxChar *" have been changed to take
  either "const wxString&" (so that they accept both Unicode and ANSI strings;
  the argument can't be NULL anymore in this case) or "const char *" (if the
  strings are always ANSI; may still be NULL). This change is normally
  backwards compatible except:

  a) Virtual functions: derived classes versions must be modified to take
     "const wxString&" as well to make sure that they continue to override the
     base class version.

  b) Passing NULL as argument: as NULL can't be unambiguously converted to
     wxString, in many cases code using it won't compile any more and NULL
     should be replaced with an empty string.

- Functions returning "const wxChar *" were changed as well. Mostly they now
  return wxString which is then transparently convertible to either "const char
  *" or "const wchar_t *" but in some cases, notably wxDateTime::ParseXXX(),
  the returned string could be NULL and so a separate helper class is used. If
  you obtain compilation errors because of this, you can always correct them by
  explicitly assigning the function return value to a variable of wanted type.
  A slightly more intrusive but better solution is to use ParseXXX() version
  with wxString::const_iterator output parameter which simply returns bool to
  indicate the parsing success.

- Some structure fields which used to be of type "const wxChar *" (such as
  wxCmdLineEntryDesc::shortName, longName and description fields) are now of
  type "const char *", you need to remove wxT() or _T() around the values used
  to initialize them (which should normally always be ASCII). If you want your
  code to remain compatible with Unicode build of previous wx version, please
  use the special wxT_2, which is the same as wxT in 2.x only, instead.

- wxIPC classes didn't work correctly in Unicode build before, this was fixed
  but at a price of breaking backwards compatibility: many methods which used
  to work with "wxChar *" before use "void *" now (some int parameters were
  also changed to size_t). While wxIPC_TEXT can still be used to transfer 7
  bit text, the new wxIPC_UTF8TEXT format is used for transferring wxStrings.
  Also notice that connection classes should change the parameter types of
  their overridden OnExecute() or override a more convenient OnExec() instead.


wxODBC and contrib libraries removal
------------------------------------

wxODBC library was unmaintained since several years and we couldn't continue
supporting it any longer so it was removed. Please use any of the other open
source ODBC libraries in the future projects.

Also the "applet", "deprecated", "fl", "mmedia" and "plot" contrib libraries
were removed as they were unmaintained and broken since several years.
The "gizmos", "ogl", "net" and "foldbar" contribs have been moved to
wxCode (see http://wxcode.sourceforge.net/complist.php); they are now
open for further development by volunteers.

The "stc" and "svg" contribs instead have been moved respectively into a new
"official" library stc and in the core lib.


Changes in behaviour not resulting in compilation errors, please read this!
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Don't pass wxString::c_str() to vararg functions any more! Due to Unicode
  changes, c_str() now returns an object and not a simple char pointer, so
  using it with vararg functions does not work any more. The preferred
  solution is to use wx-provided equivalents, e.g. wxPrintf() instead of
  printf() which has the added benefit that you don't need to call c_str()
  any more and can pass wxString objects directly. If this is impossible,
  add explicit casts to "const char*" or "const wchar_t*". See wxString
  documentation for more details.

  Notice that using wxString::c_str() with vararg functions does result in
  compilation errors with g++ and most other compilers but not MSVC. Try to
  build your code with g++ to detect all such problems at compile-time.

- Default location of wxFileConfig files has changed under Windows, you will
  need to update your code if you access these files directly.

- wxWindow::IsEnabled() now returns false if a window parent (and not
  necessarily the window itself) is disabled, new function IsThisEnabled()
  with the same behaviour as old IsEnabled() was added.

- Generating wxNavigationKeyEvent events doesn't work any more under wxGTK (and
  other platforms in the future), use wxWindow::Navigate() or NavigateIn()
  instead.

- Sizers distribute only the extra space between the stretchable items
  according to their proportions and not all available space. We believe the
  new behaviour corresponds better to user expectations but if you did rely
  on the old behaviour you will have to update your code to set the minimal
  sizes of the sizer items to be in the same proportion as the items
  proportions to return to the old behaviour.

- Interpretation of font height in pixels parameter has changed in wxFont
  ctor and SetPixelSize() in wxMSW: it is now used as character height and not
  the total cell height. If you previously used negative height to explicitly
  request character height matching, you may now change your code to use
  positive value (passing negative height still works but is undocumented and
  deprecated). If you used positive height before you should retest your code
  to check if the changes correspond to your expectations. And if you do need
  the old behaviour please contact us at wx-dev to let us know about it!

- wxWindow::Freeze/Thaw() are not virtual any more, if you overrode them in
  your code you need to override DoFreeze/DoThaw() instead now.

- wxCalendarCtrl has native implementation in wxGTK, but it has less features
  than the generic one. The native implementation is used by default, but you
  can still use wxGenericCalendarCtrl instead of wxCalendarCtrl in your code if
  you need the extra features.

- wxDocument::FileHistoryLoad() and wxFileHistory::Load() now take const
  reference to wxConfigBase argument and not just a reference, please update
  your code if you overrode these functions and change the functions in the
  derived classes to use const reference as well.

- Under MSW wxExecute() arguments are now always properly quoted, as under
  Unix, and so shouldn't contain quotes unless they are part of the argument.

- wxDocument::OnNewDocument() doesn't call OnCloseDocument() any more.

- If you use wxScrolledWindow::SetTargetWindow() you must implement its
  GetSizeAvailableForScrollTarget() method, please see its documentation for
  more details.

- Processing of pending events now requires a running event loop.
  Thus initialization code (e.g. showing a dialog) previously done in wxApp::OnRun()
  or equivalent function should now be done into wxApp::OnEventLoopEnter().
  See wxApp::OnEventLoopEnter() and wxApp::OnEventLoopExit() docs for more info.

- wxDialogs get wxEVT_SIZE events immediately after creation in wxMSW, as with
  wxFrames. This means that this event handler may be called earlier than in
  2.8, check that all the controls are initialized before using them in it.

- wxLoadFileSelector() now allows the user to select existing files only.

- Erase background events are now not generated at all when background style is
  changed. See the updated wxWindow::SetBackgroundStyle() description in the
  manual for more details.

- wxTreeCtrl::GetSelection now asserts if the tree has the wxTR_MULTIPLE style.
  Instead use GetSelections() for multiple items; or if you want only the
  single item last touched, the new wxTreeCtrl::GetFocusedItem.

- Custom log targets should be updated to override wxLog::DoLogRecord() method
  instead of DoLog() or DoLogString() and must be updated if they call the base
  class versions of these functions as this won't work any more; please see the
  documentation of wxLog for more information.

- Confusing wxGridSizer(int cols, int vgap = 0, int hgap = 0) ctor which was
  easy to mistake for wxGridSizer(int rows, int cols) overload was removed, you
  will need to specify both vertical and horizontal gap if you want to use this
  overload or specify both rows and columns and the gap otherwise. Use of the
  new constructors taking wxSize for the gap argument is preferred. The same
  applies to wxFlexGridSizer as well.

- wxBoxSizer::AddSpacer(x) now adds space in the direction of the sizer only
  and not in both this and the orthogonal directions. This behaviour is what
  most of the people expect but if you really relied on this overload adding
  space in both directions you should change your code to use AddSpacer(x, x).

- wxTextCtrl::LoadFile no longer sends a text update event.

- wxXmlDocument::Save()'s indentstep argument's interpretation was fixed
  to match the documentation: it now really is the number of spaces in
  indentation instead of being its double. Its default value was changed
  accordingly, to 2.

- wxLOCALE_CONV_ENCODING flag has no effect now, catalogs are converted
  regardless of whether the flag was specified or not. This only affects
  legacy ANSI builds.

- wxNotebook::GetSelection() returns the new page index when called from
  wxEVT_COMMAND_NOTEBOOK_PAGE_CHANGED event handler in wxMSW, not the old one.
  The new behaviour is consistent with wxGTK and more logical but different
  from the previous versions. Using wxNotebookEvent::GetSelection() instead of
  querying the notebook selection avoids the problem and is recommended.

- wxMSW-specific wxAutomationObject::GetInstance() method now creates a new
  instance if needed instead of failing if the application providing the
  requested ProgID is not running. Pass wxAutomationInstance_UseExistingOnly
  flag to it to revert to the old behaviour. It is also possible to use the
  wxAutomationInstance_SilentIfNone flag to prevent the error message if no
  currently running instances of this object are available.

- Signature of wxDataViewCustomRenderer::StartDrag() virtual method changed.
  You will need to change it in your derived renderer class too if you override
  it.

- wxDataViewCustomRenderer::Activate() and LeftClick() were replaced with the
  new ActivateCell() method. You will need to change it in your derived
  renderer class accordingly.

- wxThread::Wait() and wxThread::Delete() used to dispatch the events while
  waiting for the thread to exit in wxMSW. They still do it in default build
  with WXWIN_COMPATIBILITY_2_8 defined but won't dispatch any events, i.e. the
  default wait mode will become wxTHREAD_WAIT_BLOCK in the next wxWidgets
  release so you are strongly encouraged to upgrade your code to stop relying
  on this behaviour.

- wxEVT_CHAR_HOOK events are not generated any more if the mouse is captured to
  prevent the parent wxTopLevelWindow from interfering with the keyboard
  handling of the window that captured the mouse.

- wxDataViewCtrl::GetSelection() now returns invalid item in all ports (this
  behaved differently in wxMSW and wxGTK/wxOSX before) if more than one item
  is selected in a control with wxDV_MULTIPLE style.

- wxEVT_COMMAND_MENU_SELECTED, MENU_OPEN and CLOSE events returned a menu from
  GetEventObject() in all ports but the frame the menu was attached to in wxMSW.
  Now all ports return the menu that was opened or closed as the event object.

- wxAny now uses C locale format for the floating point numbers and not the
  current locale one, i.e. decimal point is always used.

- wxGridBagSizer::AddGrowable{Col,Row}() must now be called after the items are
  added to the sizer, i.e. the columns and rows already exist.

- wxWindow::FindWindow() skips over top level children now as finding a child
  dialog when looking for a child control could have been very unexpected.


Changes in behaviour which may result in compilation errors
-----------------------------------------------------------

- WXWIN_COMPATIBILITY_2_4 doesn't exist any more, please update your code if
  you still relied on features deprecated since version 2.4

- WXWIN_COMPATIBILITY_2_6 still exists but is 0 by default in this release and
  will be removed in 3.2. You can set it to 1 and rebuild wxWidgets to access
  the old and deprecated symbols but please consider updating your code
  instead. Here are replacements for some of the obsolete symbols:
   + wxSAVE and wxOPEN -> wxFD_SAVE and wxFD_OPEN
   + WXK_PRIOR and WXK_NEXT -> WXK_PAGEUP and WXK_PAGEDOWN
   + wxRESIZE_BOX -> wxMAXIMIZE_BOX
   + wxTHICK_FRAME -> wxRESIZE_BORDER
   + wxPROCESS_ENTER and wxPASSWORD -> wxTE_PROCESS_ENTER and wxTE_PASSWORD
   + EVT_SCROLL_ENDSCROLL -> EVT_SCROLL_CHANGED
   + NewControlId -> wxWindow::NewControlId()
   + wxFileHistory::GetNoHistoryFiles() -> wxFileHistory::GetCount()
   + wxSizerItem::SetOption() -> wxSizerItem::SetProportion()
   + wxSizer::Remove(wxWindow*) -> wxSizer::Detach()

- wxDC classes hierarchy has changed, if you derived any classes from wxDC you
  need to review them as wxDC doesn't have any virtual methods any longer and
  uses delegation instead of inheritance to present different behaviours.

- wxWindow::ProcessEvent() (and other wxEvtHandler methods inherited by wxWindow)
  has been made protected to prevent wrongly using it instead of correct
  GetEventHandler()->ProcessEvent().
  New ProcessWindowEvent() was added for convenience.

- Return type of wxString::operator[] and wxString::iterator::operator* is no
  longer wxChar (i.e. char or wchar_t), but wxUniChar. This is not a problem
  in vast majority of cases because of conversion operators, but it can break
  code that depends on the result being wxChar.

- The value returned by wxString::c_str() cannot be casted to non-const char*
  or wchar_t* anymore. The solution is to use newly added wxString methods
  char_str() (which returns a buffer convertible to char*) or wchar_str()
  (which returns a buffer convertible to wchar_t*). These methods are
  available in wxWidgets 2.8 series beginning with 2.8.4 as well.

- The value returned by wxString::operator[] or wxString::iterator cannot be
  used in switch statements anymore, because it's a class instance. Code like
  this won't compile:
     switch (str[i]) { ... }
  and has to be replaced with this:
     switch (str[i].GetValue()) { ... }

- Return type of wxString::c_str() is now a helper wxCStrData struct and not
  const wxChar*. wxCStrData is implicitly convertible to both "const char *"
  and "const wchar_t *", so this only presents a problem if the compiler cannot
  apply the conversion. This can happen in 2 cases:

  + There is an ambiguity because the function being called is overloaded to
    take both "const char *" and "const wchar_t *" as the compiler can't choose
    between them. In this case you may use s.wx_str() to call the function
    matching the current build (Unicode or not) or s.mb_str() or s.wc_str() to
    explicitly select narrow or wide version of it.

    Notice that such functions are normally not very common but unfortunately
    Microsoft decided to extend their STL with standard-incompatible overloads
    of some functions accepting "const wchar_t *" so you may need to replace
    some occurrences of c_str() with wx_str() when using MSVC 8 or later.

  + Some compilers, notably Borland C++ and DigitalMars, don't correctly
    convert operator?: operands to the same type and fail with compilation
    error instead. This can be worked around by explicitly casting to const
    wxChar*: wxLogError(_("error: %s"), !err.empty() ? (const wxChar*)err.c_str() : "")

- wxDateTime::ParseXXX() overloads don't return anything when called with
  wxCStrData argument. If you need to test the parsing success, use a newer
  overload taking wxString::const_iterator and returning bool or explicitly
  select a narrow or wide char version to use by casting c_str() to either
  "char*" or "wchar_t*". Or create a temporary wxString and parse it instead.

- wxCtime() and wxAsctime() return char*; this is incompatible with Unicode
  build in wxWidgets 2.8 that returned wchar_t*.

- DigitalMars compiler has a bug that prevents it from using
  wxUniChar::operator bool in conditions and it erroneously reports type
  conversion ambiguity in expressions such as this:
     for ( wxString::const_iterator p = s.begin(); *p; ++p )
  This can be worked around by explicitly casting to bool:
     for ( wxString::const_iterator p = s.begin(); (bool)*p; ++p )

- Virtual wxHtmlParser::AddText() takes wxString, not wxChar*, argument now.

- Functions that took wxChar* arguments that could be NULL in wxWidgets 2.8
  are deprecated and passing NULL to them won't compile anymore, wxEmptyString
  must be used instead.

- wxTmemxxx() functions take either wxChar* or char*, not void*: use memxxx()
  with void pointers.

- Removed insecure wxGets() and wxTmpnam() functions.

- Removed global GetLine() function from wx/protocol/protocol.h, use
  wxProtocol::ReadLine() instead.

- wxVariant no longer derives from wxObject. wxVariantData also no longer
  derives from wxObject; instead of using wxDynamicCast with wxVariantData you
  can use the macro wxDynamicCastVariantData with the same arguments.

- wxWindow::Next/PrevControlId() don't exist any more as they couldn't be
  implemented correctly any longer because automatically generated ids are not
  necessarily allocated consecutively now. Use GetChildren() to find the
  next/previous control sibling instead.

- Calling wxConfig::Write() with an enum value will fail to compile because
  wxConfig now tries to convert all unknown types to wxString automatically.
  The simplest solution is to cast the enum value to int.

- Several wxImage methods which previously had "long bitmaptype" parameters
  have been changed to accept "wxBitmapType bitmaptype", please use enum
  wxBitmapType in your code.

- wxGridCellEditor::EndEdit() signature has changed and it was split in two
  functions, one still called EndEdit() and ApplyEdit(). See the documentation
  of the new functions for more details about how grid editors should be
  written now.

- wxEVT_GRID_CELL_CHANGE event renamed to wxEVT_GRID_CELL_CHANGED and shouldn't
  be vetoed any more, use the new wxEVT_GRID_CELL_CHANGING event to do it.

- wxListCtrlCompare function used with wxListCtrl::SortItems() must now declare
  its third parameter as wxIntPtr and not long (this allows passing pointers
  to it under 64 bit platforms too).

- Global wxPendingEvents and wxPendingEventsLocker objects were removed.
  You may use wxEventLoopBase::SuspendProcessingOfPendingEvents instead of
  locking wxPendingEventsLocker now.

- wxBitmapButton::GetBitmapXXX() overloads returning non-const wxBitmap
  references have been removed, modifying the returned bitmaps never worked and
  now results in compile-time error.

- wxLogXXX() are now macros, not functions. Because of this calling them with
  an explicit scope resolution operator ("::wxLogError()") doesn't work any
  longer, just remove it. Also notice that using them inside an "if" statement
  without enclosing parentheses results in warnings from g++ with -Wparentheses,
  add parentheses around the if statement body to work around it.

- wxList::Member() now returns bool and not a pointer/iterator. This shouldn't
  require any changes as it was always meant to be used for checking for the
  presence of an element in the list only. If you used it as Find(), simple do
  use Find() instead.

- wxLongLongFmtSpec is now a normal and not wide string so you will need to
  change expressions of the form wxT("%") wxLongLongFmtSpec wxT("x") to
  just "%" wxLongLongFmtSpec "x", i.e. simply remove wxT() from the strings you
  concatenate with it.

- wxST_MARKUP doesn't exist any more, use wxControl::SetLabelMarkup() instead.

- wxComboBox::IsEmpty(), which was previously available in some ports (but not
  wxMSW), doesn't exist any more, use either IsListEmpty() or IsTextEmpty().

- wxSingleChoiceDialog ctors and Create() now have 2 overloaded versions: one
  taking void** client data and the deprecated one taking char**. This can
  result in compilation errors due to an ambiguity between them if you pass
  NULL as client data. To fix this, cast NULL explicitly to "void**".

- wxChoicebookEvent, wxListbookEvent, wxNotebookEvent, wxToolbookEvent and
  wxTreebookEvent are now all synonyms for wxBookCtrlEvent. The existing code
  using the old names continues to work but they can't be forward-declared
  any more. Use wxBookCtrlEvent in your code if you need to forward-declare
  it or just include the appropriate header instead of forward declaration.

- wxStandardPaths class can't be created now. This was never the right thing
  to do, wxStandardPaths::Get() always had to be used to access the global
  object of the correct type but now doing it results in a compilation error.


Deprecated methods and their replacements
-----------------------------------------

- wxCreateGreyedImage() deprecated, use wxImage::ConvertToGreyscale() instead.
- wxString::GetWriteBuf() and UngetWriteBuf() deprecated, using wxStringBuffer
  or wxStringBufferLength instead.
- wxDIRCTRL_SHOW_FILTERS style is deprecated, filters are alwsys shown if
  specified so this style should simply be removed
- wxDocManager::MakeDefaultName() replaced by MakeNewDocumentName() and
  wxDocument::GetPrintableName() with GetUserReadableName() which are simpler
  to use
- wxXmlProperty class was renamed to wxXmlAttribute in order to use standard
  terminology. Corresponding wxXmlNode methods were renamed to use
  "Attribute" instead of "Property" or "Prop" in their names.
- wxConnection::OnExecute() is not formally deprecated yet but new code should
  use simpler OnExec() version which is called with wxString argument
- Various wxMenuItem methods were deprecated in favour of more consisently
  named new versions:
    . GetLabel() is now GetItemLabelText()
    . GetText() is not GetItemLabel()
    . GetLabelFromText() is now GetLabelText()
    . SetText() is now SetItemLabel()
- wxBrush's, wxPen's SetStyle() and GetStyle() as well as the wxBrush/wxPen
  ctor now take respectively a wxBrushStyle and a wxPenStyle value instead of a
  plain "int style"; use the new wxBrush/wxPen style names (wxBRUSHSTYLE_XXX
  and wxPENSTYLE_XXX) instead of the old deprecated wxXXX styles.
- EVT_GRID_CELL_CHANGE was deprecated, use EVT_GRID_CELL_CHANGED instead if you
  don't veto the event in its handler and EVT_GRID_CELL_CHANGING if you do.
- EVT_CALENDAR_DAY event has been deprecated, use EVT_CALENDAR_SEL_CHANGED.
- EVT_CALENDAR_MONTH and EVT_CALENDAR_YEAR events are deprecated,
  use EVT_CALENDAR_PAGE_CHANGED which replaces both of them.
- wxCalendarCtrl::EnableYearChange() and wxCAL_NO_YEAR_CHANGE are deprecated.
  There is no replacement for this functionality, it is being dropped as it is
  not available in native wxCalendarCtrl implementations.
- wxDC::SetClippingRegion(const wxRegion&) overload is deprecated as it used
  different convention from the other SetClippingRegion() overloads: wxRegion
  passed to it was interpreted in physical, not logical, coordinates. Replace
  it with SetDeviceClippingRegion() if this was the correct thing to do in your
  code.
- wxTE_AUTO_SCROLL style is deprecated as it's always on by default anyhow.
- wxThreadHelper::Create() has been renamed to CreateThread which has a better
  name for a mix-in class, and allows setting the thread type.
- wxDos2UnixFilename, wxUnix2DosFilename, wxStripExtension, wxGetTempFileName,
  wxExpandPath, wxContractPath, wxRealPath, wxCopyAbsolutePath, wxSplitPath
  were deprecated in favour of wxFileName methods. See docs for more info.
- wxEvtHandler::TryValidator/Parent() are deprecated, override the new and
  documented TryBefore/After() methods if you used to override these ones.
- wxGetMultipleChoices() is deprecated, use wxGetSelectedChoices() which has
  the same signature but returns -1 and not 0 if the dialog was cancelled.
- building the windows which are placed inside wxStaticBoxes as siblings of the
  wxStaticBox is still allowed but it's deprecated as it gives some problems
  on some ports (e.g. wxGTK).
  You should now create windows placed inside a wxStaticBox as children of
  the static box itself.
- wxMouseState::{Left,Middle,Right}Down() were renamed to XXXIsDown() for
  consistency with wxMouseEvent and the old names were deprecated.
- wxFont::SetNoAntiAliasing() was deprecated, it never really worked in most
  ports and was always marked as "experimental" API. It will be replaced with
  wxDC-level anti-aliasing control in the future.
- wxValidator::SetBellOnError() incorrectly interpreted its argument (it
  disabled the bell when it was true) and was replaced by SuppressBellOnError()
  with more expected semantics.
- wxPORTRAIT and wxLANDSCAPE are now elements of wxPrintOrientation enum and
  wxPrintData::SetOrientation(int) takes wxPrintOrientation and not int.
- Second parameter of wxSlider::SetTickFreq(int n, int pos) is deprecated,
  simply remove it from your code and use wxSlider::SetTickFreq(int n) as it
  was never used anyhow.
- wxSingleChoiceDialog ctor and Create() take "void**" client data pointer
  instead of "char**". As the client data is typically untyped, you should
  simply remove the casts to "char**" which you probably have in your code if
  you use these functions.
- wxDataViewCtrl::StartEditor(item, n) taking column index is now deprecated,
  use EditItem(item, GetColumn(n)), which takes the column itself, instead.
- wxWindow::MakeModal() is deprecated, use wxDialog::ShowModal() instead if
  possible or wxWindowDisabler otherwise.


Changes in behaviour visible to end users
-----------------------------------------

- wxTextCtrl::SaveFile() now creates UTF-8-encoded files instead of using the
  default locale encoding. This ensures that the entire text control contents
  can be saved and is consistent with the use of UTF-8 by default in the other
  places, notably DoLoadFile(), but is a change since the previous versions.
  If you need the old behaviour, consider calling wxFFile::Write() explicitly
  with wxConvCurrent conversion parameter.

- In wxMSW wxSpinCtrl used to prevent the user from entering more digits than
  could fit in its visible area. This was inconsistent with the other ports and
  now the control scrolls if too much text is added.


Build system changes
--------------------

- Cocoa is now used by default under OS X instead of Carbon. Pass --with-carbon
  option to configure to use wxCarbon.

- In wxMSW makefile builds, "_x64" is used instead of "_amd64" when compiling
  for this architecture in the architecture-specific paths and library names.
  TARGET_CPU can still be specified as "amd64" for compatibility but "x64"
  should be used now.

- Official wxMSW binaries, i.e. those built with OFFICIAL_BUILD=1, built with
  MSVC now include the version of the compiler used and the architecture if
  it's not the default "x86". E.g. a library built with MSVC 10 for amd64 is
  called "wxbase294ud_vc110_amd64.dll" now.

- MSVC projects don't include neither wxUniversal nor ANSI (non-Unicode)
  configurations any more. The simplest way to build wxWidgets in these
  configurations if you need them is to use nmake from the command line with
  WXUNIV=1 or UNICODE=0 command line parameter respectively.

- The manifest is not included by wx/msw/wx.rc any longer for MSVC compiler.
  If you're using MSVC 6 or 7 which require it, you must explicitly define
  wxUSE_RC_MANIFEST=1 and also predefine WX_CPU_X86 in the resource compiler
  options in your project file.


Major new features in this release
----------------------------------

- wxWidgets is now always built with Unicode support but provides the same
  simple (i.e. "char *"-tolerant) API as was available in ANSI build in the
  past.

- wxWidgets may now use either wchar_t (UTF-16/32) or UTF-8 internally,
  depending on what is optimal for the target platform.

- New webview library, implementing wxWebView: a wrapper for the native
  platform web engine with full support for HTML and JavaScript.

- New propgrid library containing wxPropertyGrid and related classes.

- New ribbon library for advanced toolbars.

- Many enhancements to wxDataViewCtrl.

- Event loops, timers and sockets can now be used in wxBase, without GUI.

- Events can now be connected to any functor, not necessarily a method of
  wxEvtHandler-derived class. The compile-time safety was also improved.

- Documentation for wxWidgets has been converted from LaTex to C++ headers
  with Doxygen comments and significantly improved in the process (screenshots
  of various controls were added, more identifiers are now linked to their
  definition &c). Any reports about inaccuracies in the documentation are
  welcome (and due to using the simple Doxygen syntax it is now easier than
  ever to submit patches correcting them! :-)

- Support for persistent objects automatically saving and restoring their state
  was added.

2.5.2
-----

All:

- Hindi translation added (Dhananjaya Sharma)
- Brazilian Portuguese translation added (E. A. Tacao)
- wxDynamicCast() now uses static_cast<wxObject *> internally and so using it
  with anything not deriving from wxObject will fail at compile time (instead
  of run-time) now
- when wxUSE_STL == 1 and STL provides quasi-standard hash_map/hash_set,
  wxHashMap/wxHashSet are just typedefs for them. This makes impossible
  to forward declare these classes.

All (GUI):

- wxHtmlWindow now delays image scaling until rendering,
  resulting in much better display of scaled images

- The old wxADJUST_MINSIZE behaviour is now the default behaviour for
  sizer items that are windows.  This means that GetAdjustedBestSize
  will now be called by default to determine the minimum size that a
  window in a sizer should have.  If you want to still use the initial
  size (and not the BestSize) then use the wxFIXED_MINSIZE flag.  When
  windows are added to a sizer their initial size is made the window's
  min size using SetSizeHints, and calls to wxSizer::SetItemMinSize
  are also forwarded to SetSizeHints for window items.
- added wxRegEx::GetMatchCount()
- it is now possible to display images in wxHtmlListBox

  even try to do it by default -- now it does
- wxTaskBarIcon must be explicitly destroyed now, otherwise the application
  won't exit even though there are no top level windows
- wxFileName::GetModificationTime() works with opened files too now
- wxDC::GetClippingBox() now works even for clipping regions created by Windows
- fixed wxFileDataObject in Unicode build (Alex D)
- subindented paragraphs support (Tim Kosse)

wxGTK:

- added support for wxTE_RIGHT and wxTE_CENTRE styles under GTK2 (Mart Raudsepp)

wxMotif:

- removed wxMenuItem::DeleteSubMenu()
- wxButtons use Motif default size, which is smaller than it used to be
  and closer to wxMSW/wxGTK look. This can be disabled by setting
  motif.largebuttons system option to 1 (see wxSystemOptions).

wxUniv/X11:

- implemented DrawRoundedRectangle() (clawghoul)

wxHTML:

- improved tables and lists layout algorithms (Tim Kosse)

OLD CHANGES
===========

INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES SINCE 2.2.x
================================

    Please take a few minutes to read the following list, especially
    paying attention to the most important changes which are marked
    with '!' in the first column.

    Also please note that you should ensure that WXWIN_COMPATIBILITY_2_2
    is defined to 1 if you wish to retain maximal compatibility with 2.2
    series -- however you are also strongly encouraged to try to compile
    your code without this define as it won't be default any longer in
    2.6 release.

    NB: if you want to build your program with different major versions
        of wxWidgets you will probably find the wxCHECK_VERSION() macro
        (see the documentation) useful.


wxBase:

! wxArray<T>::Remove(size_t) has been removed to fix compilation problems
  under 64 bit architectures, please replace it with RemoveAt() in your
  code.

! wxArray<T> macros have been changed to fix runtime problems under 64 bit
  architectures and as a side effect of this WX_DEFINE_ARRAY() can only be
  used now for the pointer types, WX_DEFINE_ARRAY_INT should be used for the
  arrays containing non-pointers.

- wxObject::CopyObject() and Clone() methods were removed because they
  simply don't make sense for all objects

- wxEvent now has a pure virtual Clone() method which must be implemented
  by all derived classes, if you have user-defined event classes please
  add "wxEvent *Clone() const { return new MyEvent(*this); }" line to them

- small change to wxStopWatch::Pause() semantics, please see the documentation

- unlikely but possible incompatibility: the definition of TRUE has changed
  from "1" to "(bool)1" (and the same thing for FALSE), so the code which
  could be erroneously compiled previously such as doing "return FALSE" from
  a function returning a pointer would stop compiling now (but this change
  is not supposed to have any effects on valid code)

- another minor change: wxApp::OnAssert() has a new "cond" argument, you
  must modify YourApp::OnAssert() signature if you were using it to override
  the default assert handling.

All (GUI):

! the event type constants are not constants any more but are dynamically
  allocated during run-time which means that they can't be used as case labels
  in the switch()es, you must rewrite them to use if()s instead

  You may also define WXWIN_COMPATIBILITY_EVENT_TYPES to get the old behaviour
  but this is strongly discouraged, please consider changing your code
  instead!

! wxDialog does not derive from wxPanel any longer - if you were using it in
  your code, please update it. The quick fix for the most cases is to replace
  the occurrences of wxPanel with wxWindow.

! if you handle (and don't skip) EVT_KEY_DOWN, the EVT_CHAR event is not
  generated at all, so you must call event.Skip() in your OnKeyDown() if
  you want to get OnChar() as well

- in general, the key events sent for the various non ASCII key combinations
  have been changed to make them consistent over all supported platforms,
  please see the wxKeyEvent documentation for details

- wxYES_NO is now wxYES | wxNO and the manifest values of both wxYES and wxNO
  have changed (to fix some unfortunate clashes), please check your code to
  ensure that no tests for wxYES or wxNO are broken: for example, the following
  will *NOT* work any longer:

        if ( flags & wxYES_NO )
                ... do something ...
        if ( flags & wxYES )
                ... do something else ...

- static wxWizard::Create() doesn't exist any more, the wizards are created
  in the same way as all the other wxWindow objects, i.e. by directly using
  the ctor

- wxGLCanvas now derives directly from wxWindow, not wxScrolledWindow

- wxGridCellAttrProvider class API changed, you will need to update your code
  if you derived any classes from it

- wxImage::ComputeHistogram()'s signature changed to
  unsigned long ComputeHistogram(wxImageHistogram&) const

- wxEvtHandler cannot be copied/assigned any longer - this never worked but
  now it results in compile-time error instead of run-time crashes

- WXK_NUMLOCK and WXK_SCROLL keys no longer result in EVT_CHAR() events,
  they only generate EVT_KEY_DOWN/UP() ones

- the dialogs use wxApp::GetTopWindow() as the parent implicitly if the
  parent specified is NULL, use wxDIALOG_NO_PARENT style to prevent this
  from happening

- several obsolete synonyms are only retained in WXWIN_COMPATIBILITY_2_2 mode:
  for example, use wxScrolledWindow::GetViewStart() now instead of ViewStart()
  and GetCount() instead of Number() in many classes

- wxCmdLineParser does not use wxLog to output messages anymore.
  to obtain the previous behaviour, add
  wxMessageOutput::Set(new wxMessageOutputLog); to your program
  (you will need to #include <wx/msgout.h>)

wxMSW:

! build system changed: setup.h is not a static file in include/wx any more
  but is created as part of the build process under lib/<toolkit>/wx
  where <toolkit> is of the form (msw|univ)[dll][u][d]. You'll need to update
  the include path in your make/project files appropriately. Furthermore,
  xpm.lib is no longer used by wxMSW, it was superseded by the wxXPMDecoder
  class. You'll need to remove all references to xpm.lib from your
  make/project files. Finally, the library names have changed as well and now
  use the following consistent naming convention: wxmsw[ver][u][d].(lib|dll)
  where 'u' appears for Unicode version, 'd' -- for the debug one and version
  is only present for the DLLs builds.

- child frames appear in the taskbar by default now, use wxFRAME_NO_TASKBAR
  style to avoid it

- all overloads of wxDC::SetClippingRegion() combine the given region with the
  previously selected one instead of replacing it

- wxGetHomeDir() uses HOME environment variable and if it is set will not
  return the programs directory any longer but its value (this function has
  never been meant to return the programs directory anyhow)

- wxHTML apps don't need to include wx/html/msw/wxhtml.rc in resources file
  anymore. The file was removed from wxMSW


Unix ports:

! You should use `wx-config --cxxflags` in your makefiles instead of
  `wx-config --cflags` for compiling C++ files. CXXFLAGS contains CFLAGS
  and the compiler flags for C++ files only, CFLAGS should still be used
  to compile pure C files.


wxThread and related classes:

- The thread-related classes have been heavily changed since 2.2.x versions
  as the old code had many serious problems. This could have resulted in
  semantical changes other than those mentioned here, please review use of
  wxThread, wxMutex and wxCondition classes in your code.

! wxCondition now *must* be used with a mutex, please read the (updated) class
  documentation for details and revise your code accordingly: this change was
  unfortunately needed as it was impossible to ensure the correct behaviour
  (i.e. absence of race conditions) using the old API.

- wxMutex is not recursive any more in POSIX implementation (it hasn't been
  recursive in 2.2.x but was in 2.3.1 and 2.3.2), please refer to the class
  documentation for the discussion of the recursive mutexes.

- wxMutex::IsLocked() doesn't exist any more and should have never existed:
  this is was unique example of a thread-unsafe-by-design method.

- Rearranged documentation a bit.
- Sash window uses area of first frame/dialog to paint over when drawing
  the dragged sash, not just the sash window itself (it clipped to the right
  or below).
- Made resource sample use the correct Cancel button id.
- Moved wxProp to main library (generic directory), created proplist
  sample.
- Added bombs and fractal samples.

Beta 1, December 24th 1998
--------------------------

wxGTK:

- Various

wxMSW, wxMotif: not in sync with this release.


Alpha 18, December 29th 1998
----------------------------

wxMSW:

- Win16 support working again (VC++ 1.5)
- Win16 now uses generic wxNotebook, wxListCtrl,
  wxTreeCtrl -- more or less working now, although
  a little work on wxNotebook is still needed.
  Under 16-bit Windows, get assertion when you click
  on a tab.
- Wrote 16-bit BC++ makefiles: samples don't yet link.
- Added CodeWarrior support to distribution courtesy
  of Stefan Csomor.

wxMotif:

- Cured scrolling problem: scrollbars now show/hide themselves
  without (permanently) resizing the window.
- Removed some commented-out lines in wxScrolledWindow::AdjustScrollbars
  that disabled scrollbar paging.
- Set background colour of drawing area in wxWindow, so e.g. wxListCtrl
  colours correctly.
- Removed major bug whereby dialogs were unmanaged automatically
  when any button was pressed.
- Fixed colours of wxWindow scrollbars, made list and text controls
  have a white background.
- Fixed dialog colour setting.
- Added settable fonts and colours for wxMenu/wxMenuBar. Now
  they have sensible colours by default.
- Fixed a bug in wxStaticBox.
- Cured wxTreeCtrl bug: now works pretty well!
- Debugged DrawEllipticArc (a ! in the wrong place).
- Added SetClippingRegion( const wxRegion& region ).
- Added wxPoint, wxSize, wxRect versions of SetSize etc.

Alpha 17, November 22nd 1998
----------------------------

wxMSW:

- More documentation updates, especially for
  wxLayoutWindow classes and debugging facilities.
- Changed wxDebugContext to use wxDebugLog instead
  of wxTrace.
- Now supports VC++ 6.0, and hopefully BC++ 5.0.
  However, DLL support may be broken for BC++ since
  VC++ 6 required changing of WXDLLEXPORT keyword
  position.
- Numerous miscellaneous changes.

wxMotif:

- Reimplemented MDI using wxNotebook instead of the MDI widgets, which
  were too buggy (probably not design for dynamic addition/removal of
  child frames).
- Some improvements to the wxNotebook implementation.
- wxToolBar now uses a bulletin board instead of a form, in an attempt
  to make it possible to add ordinary wxControls to a toolbar.
- Cured problem with not being able to use global memory operators,
  by defining two more global operators, so that the delete will match
  the debugging implementation.
- Added wxUSE_DEBUG_NEW_ALWAYS so we can distinguish between using
  global memory operators (usually OK) and #defining new to be
  WXDEBUG_NEW (sometimes it might not be OK).
- Added time.cpp to makefile; set wxUSE_DATETIME to 1.
- Added a parent-existence check to popup menu code to make it not crash.
- Added some optimization in wxWindow::SetSize to produce less flicker.
  It remains to be seen whether this produces any resize bugs.

It's a long time since I updated this file. Previously done:

- wxFrame, wxDialog done.
- wxScrolledWindow done (but backing pixmap not used at present).
- wxBitmap done though could be tidied it up at some point.
- Most basic controls are there, if not rigorously tested.
- Some MDI support (menus appear on child frames at present).
- wxNotebook almost done.
- wxToolBar done (horizontal only, which would be easy to extend
  to vertical toolbars).

More recently:

- Colour and font changing done (question mark over what happens
  to scrollbars).
- Accelerators done (for menu items and buttons). Also event loop
  tidied up in wxApp so that events are filtered through ProcessXEvent.
- wxWindow::GetUpdateRegion should now work.

Alpha 16, September 8th 1998
----------------------------

wxMSW:

- Added wxSashWindow, wxSashLayoutWindow classes, and sashtest
  sample.
- Guilhem's socket classes added, plus wxsocket sample.
- A few more makefiles added.
- GnuWin32/BC++ compatibility mods.
- Further doc updates.
- wxProp updates for correct working with wxGTK.

wxMotif:

- First start at Motif port.
- Made makefiles for wxMotif source directory and minimal sample.
- First go at wxApp, wxWindow, wxDialog, wxPen, wxBrush, wxFont,
  wxColour, wxButton, wxCheckBox, wxTextCtrl, wxStaticText,
  wxMenu, wxMenuItem, wxMenuBar

Alpha 15, August 31st 1998
--------------------------

wxMSW:

- wxBitmap debugged.
- wxDC::GetDepth added.
- Contribution added whereby wxBitmap will be
  converted to DC depth if they don't match.
- wxConfig API improved, documentation updated.
- Printing classes name conventions cleaned up.
- wxUpdateUIEvent now derives from wxCommandEvent
  so event can travel up the window hierarchy.

Alpha 14, July 31st 1998
------------------------

wxMSW:

- Toolbar API has been simplified, and now
  wxFrame::GetClientArea returns the available client
  area when toolbar, status bar etc. have been accounted for.
  wxFrame::CreateToolBar added in line with CreateStatusBar.
- Documentation updates, incl. for wxToolBar.
- New wxAcceleratorTable class plus wxFrame::SetAcceleratorTable.
- Various additions from other folk, e.g. streams, wxConfig
  changes, wxNotebook.
- Added wxDocMDIParentFrame, wxDocMDIChildFrame for doc/view.

Alpha 13, July 8th 1998
-----------------------

wxMSW:

- Implemented wxPoint as identical to POINT on Windows, and
  altered wxDC wxPoint functions to use wxPoint directly in
  Windows functions, for efficiency.
- Cured wxASSERT bug in wxStatusBar95.
- #ifdefed out some bits in oleutils.cpp for compilers that
  don't support it.
- Added some operators to wxPoint, wxSize.
- Added inline wxDC functions using wxPoint, wxSize, wxRect.

Alpha 12, July 7th 1998
-----------------------

wxMSW:

- Added wxApp::GetComCtl32Version, and wxTB_FLAT style, so can
  have flat toolbars on Win98 or Win95 with IE >= 3 installed.

Alpha 11, July 3rd 1998
-----------------------

wxMSW:

- Added thread.h, thread.cpp.
- Changed Enabled, Checked to IsEnabled, IsChecked in wxMenu,
  wxMenuBar.
- Changed wxMenuItem::SetBackColor to SetBackgroundColour,
  SetTextColor to SetTextColour, and added or made public several
  wxMenuItem accessors.
- Added two overloads to wxRegion::Contains. Added
  wxRegion::IsEmpty for a more consistent naming convention.
- Added Vadim's wxDataObject and wxDropSource.
- ENTER/LEAVE events now work.
- Cured wxMemoryDC bug where the DC wasn't being deleted.
- Cured wxGauge SetSize major bugginess.
- Cured problem where if a GDI object was created on the stack,
  then went out of scope, then another object was selected into
  the DC, GDI objects would leak. This is because the assignment
  to e.g. wxDC::m_pen would delete the GDI object without it first
  being selected out of the DC. Cured by selecting the old DC object
  first, then doing the assignment.
- Split up wxGaugeMSW, wxGauge95, wxSliderMSW, wxSlider95
- Various other bug fixes and additions.

Generic:

- Major work on Dialog Editor (still plenty to go).
- Expanded documentation a bit more.

Alpha 10, May 7th 1998
----------------------

wxMSW:

- Added desiredWidth, desiredHeight parameters to wxBitmapHandler
  and wxIcon functions so that you can specify what size of
  icon should be loaded. Probably will remain a Windows-specific thing.
- wxStatusBar95 now works for MDI frames.
- Toolbars in MDI frames now behave normally. They still
  require application-supplied positioning code though.
- Changed installation instructions, makefiles and batch files
  for compiling with Gnu-Win32/Mingw32/EGCS. Also timercmn.cpp
  change to support Mingw32/EGCS. Bison now used by default.

Alpha 9, April 27th 1998
------------------------

wxMSW:

- Cured bug in wxStatusBar95 that caused a crash if multiple
  fields were used.
- Added Gnu-Win32 b19/Mingw32 support by changing resource
  compilation and pragmas.
- Cured wxMenu bug introduced in alpha 8 - didn't respond to
  commands because VZ changed the id setting in wxMenu::MSWCommand.

Generic:

- Corrected some bugs, such as the wxModule compilation problem.
- Added Gnu-Win32 b19/Mingw32 support by changing resource
  compilation and pragmas.
- Changed SIZEOF to WXSIZEOF.

Alpha 8, April 17th 1998
------------------------

wxMSW:

- Added IsNull to wxGDIObject to check if the ref data is present or not.
- Added PNG handler and sample - doesn't work for 16-bit PNGs for
  some reason :-(
- Added wxJoystick class and event handling, and simple demo.
- Added simple wxWave class. Needs Stop() function.
- Added wxModule (module.h/module.cpp) to allow definition
  of modules to be initialized and cleaned up on wxWidgets
  startup/exit.
- Start of Mingw32 compatibility (see minimal and dialogs samples
  makefile.m95 files, and install.txt).
- Note: Windows printing has stopped working... will investigate.
VADIM'S CHANGES:
- Updated wxString: bug fixes, added wxArrayString, some
  compatibility functions.
- Updated log.h/cpp, added wxApp::CreateLogTarget.
- file.h: new wxTempFile class.
- defs.h: added wxSB_SIZE_GRIP for wxStatusBar95
- statbr95: wxStatusBar95 control.
- registry.h/cpp: wxRegKey class for Win95 registry.
- listbox.cpp: corrected some bugs with owner-drawn listboxes.
- wxConfig and wxFileConfig classes.

Generic:

- Added src/other/png, src/other/zlib directories.
- Added samples/png.
- IMPORTANT: Changed 'no id' number from 0 to -1, in wxEVT_ macros.
  Porters, please check particularly your wxTreeCtrl and wxListCtrl
  header files.
- Added modules.h/cpp, config.cpp, fileconf.cpp, textfile.cpp/h.

Alpha 7, March 30th 1998
------------------------

wxMSW:

- Added tab classes, tab sample.
- Now can return FALSE from OnInit and windows will be
  cleaned up properly before exit.
- Improved border handling so panels don't get borders
  automatically.
- Debugged MDI activation from Window menu.
- Changes to memory debug handling, including checking for
  memory leaks on application exit - but see issues.txt for
  unresolved issues.
- Added wxTaskBarIcon (taskbar.cpp/h, plus samples/taskbar)
  to allow maintenance of an icon in the Windows 95 taskbar
  tray area.
- Got MFC sample working (MFC and wxWidgets in the same
  application), partly by tweaking ntwxwin.mak settings.
- Got DLL compilation working again (VC++).
- Changed wxProp/Dialog Editor filenames.

Generic:

- Added tab classes, tab sample.
- Revised memory.cpp, memory.h slightly; memory.h now #defines
  new to WXDEBUG_NEW in DEBUG mode. Windows implementation app.cpp
  now checks for leaks on exit. Added memcheck sample.
  See src/msw/issues.txt for more details.
- resource.h, resource.cpp changed to make wxDefaultResourceTable
  a pointer. Now initialize resource system with
  wxInitializeResourceSystem and wxCleanUpResourceSystem, to
  allow better control of memory.
- wxString now derives from wxObject, to enable memory leak
  checking.
- Added some #include fixes in various files, plus changed
  float to long in wxToolBar files.

Alpha 6, March 10th 1998
------------------------

wxMSW:

- Found stack error bug - stopped unwanted OnIdle recursion.
- Removed bug in wxTreeCtrl::InsertItem I added in alpha 5.
- Changed exit behaviour in wxApp/wxFrame/wxDialog. Now will
  check if the number of top-level windows is zero before
  exiting. Also, wxApp::GetTopWindow will return either
  m_topWindow or the first member of wxTopLevelWindows, so you
  don't have to call wxApp::SetTopWindow.
- Added dynarray.h/dynarray.cpp (from Vadim).
- Added first cut at OLE drag and drop (from Vadim). dnd sample
  added. Drop target only at this stage. See src/msw/ole/*.cpp,
  wx/include/msw/ole/*.h. WIN32 only because of UUID usage.
  Doesn't work with GnuWin32 - no appropriate headers e.g. for
  IUnknown.
  Doesn't work with BC++ either - crashes on program startup.
- Added Vadim's owner-draw modifications - will probably remain
  Windows-only. This enhances wxMenu, wxListBox. See ownerdrw sample.
- Added wxLB_OWNERDRAW for owner-draw listboxes.
- Vadim's wxCheckListBox derives from wxListBox. See checklst sample.
  Doesn't entirely work for WIN16.
- Vadim has added wxMenuItem as a separate file menuitem.cpp. It
  can also be used as an argument to wxMenu::Append, not just for
  internal implementation.
- Some #ifdefs done for MINGW32 compilation (just alter OPTIONS
  in makeg95.env, together with mingw32.bat). However, resource
  binding is not working yet so most apps with dialogs crash.

Generic:

- Added Vadim's dynarray.h, dynarray.cpp.
- Added Vadim's menuitem.cpp.
- Added Windows-specific wxCheckListBox,
  owner-draw wxListBox, and drag-and-drop
  (see docs/msw/changes.txt).

Alpha 5, 14th February 1998
--------------------------

wxMSW:

- GENERIC AND MSW-SPECIFIC CODE NOW TREATED AS TWO SEPARATE
  DISTRIBUTIONS. This change log will therefore now refer to
  the Windows-specific code only. See docs/changes.txt for generic
  changes.
- Removed Windows-specific reference counting system (GDI
  resources were cleaned up in idle time) - minimal
  advantages now we have a wxWin reference counting system.
- Added missing WXDLLEXPORT keywords so DLL compilation works
  again.
- Removed most warnings for GnuWin32 compilation.
- Added wxRegion/wxRegionIterator, but haven't yet used it in
  e.g. wxDC.

Generic:

- GENERIC AND MSW-SPECIFIC CODE NOW TREATED AS TWO SEPARATE
  DISTRIBUTIONS. This change log will therefore now refer to
  the generic code only. See docs/msw/changes.txt for Windows-specific
  changes.
- Readmes, change logs and installation files now go in
  platform-specific directories under docs, e.g. docs/msw,
  docs/gtk.
- Added DECLARE_APP and IMPLEMENT_APP macros so wxApp object gets
  created dynamically, not as a global object.
- Put wxColour into wx/msw/colour.h, src/msw/colour.cpp.
- Changed names of some include/wx/generic headers to be
  consistent and to conform to gcc pragma conventions. Also
  changed choicesg.cpp to choicdgg.cpp.
- Added gcc pragmas.
- Added gtk inclusion in include/wx headers.
- Added consistent file headings to source and headers.
- Removed lang.cpp, lang.h and references to wxSTR_... variables;
  added a few references to wxTransString.
- Added operator to wxTransString that converts automatically
  to wxString, so we can say e.g. wxMessageBox(wxTransString("Hello"), ...).
- samples/internat now works (minimally).
- Added wxMouseEvent::GetPosition and
  wxMouseEvent::GetLogicalPosition, both returning wxPoints.
- Made wxSize and wxRect contain longs not ints.
- Cured some memory leaks (thanks Vadim).
- Tidied up OnIdle and introduced RequestMore/MoreRequested so
  will only keep processing OnIdle if it returns TRUE from
  MoreRequested.

Alpha 4, 31st January 1998
--------------------------

All:

- Changed wxDC functions to take longs instead of floats. GetSize now takes
  integer pointers, plus a version that returns a wxSize.
- const keyword added to various wxDC functions.
- Under Windows, wxDC no longer has any knowledge of whether
  an associated window is scrolled or not. Instead, the device
  origin is set by wxScrolledWindow in wxScrolledWindow::PrepareDC.
- wxScrolledWindow applications can optionally override the virtual OnDraw
  function instead of using the OnPaint event handler. The wxDC passed to
  OnDraw will be translated by PrepareDC to reflect scrolling.
  When drawing outside of OnDraw, must call PrepareDC explicitly.
- wxToolBarBase/wxToolBarSimple similarly changed to allow for
  scrolling toolbars.
- Integrated wxPostScriptDC patches for 1.xx by Chris Breeze,
  to help printing with multiple pages.
- IPC classes given base classes (wxConnectionBase etc.) which
  define the API used by different implementations. DDE
  implementation updated to use these base classes.
- wxHelpInstance now separated into wxHelpControllerBase (base
  for all implementations), wxWinHelpController (uses standard
  WinHelp), wxXLPHelpController (talks to wxHelp by DDE or
  TCP/IP). There will be others eventually, such as
  wxHTMLHelpController for Microsoft (and Netscape?) HTML Help.
- Added Vadim Zeitlin's wxString class plus
  internationalization code (gettext simulation, wxLocale, etc.).
  New files from Vadim:
  include\wx\string.h
  include\wx\debug.h
  include\wx\file.h
  include\wx\log.h
  include\wx\intl.h
  src\common\string.cpp
  src\common\log.cpp
  src\common\intl.cpp
  src\common\file.cpp
  No longer use GNU wxString files.
- Split off file-related functions into include\wx\filefn.h and
  src\common\filefn.cpp.
- Borland C++ support (WIN32) for main library and
  samples, using makefile.b32 files.
- Preparation done for allowing BC++ to compile wxWin as a DLL,
  including changes to defs.h.
- wxIntPoint removed, wxPoint is now int, and wxRealPoint
  introduced.
- Added wxShowEvent (generated when window is being shown or
  hidden).
- Got minimal, docview, mdi samples working for 16-bit VC++ and
  cured 16-bit problem with wxTextCtrl (removed global memory
  trick).
- Updated GnuWin32 makefiles, checked minimal, mdi, docview samples.

Alpha 3, September 1997
-----------------------

All:

- wxListCtrl, wxTreeCtrl, wxImageList classes done.
- Instigated new file hierarchy, split files and classes up more logically.
- PrologIO and some other utils now put into core library.
- Revamped print/preview classes, added wxPageSetupDialog.
- Started documentation.

Alpha 2, 30th April 1997
------------------------

All:

- EVT_... macros now have at least one argument, for conformance
  with MetroWerks compiler.
- Added ids to .wxr file format.
- Got Dialog Editor compiled and running again but need
  to extend functionality to be in line with new controls.
  Added dialoged\test app to allow dynamic loading of .wxr files
  for testing purposes.
- Rewrote wxBitmap to allow installable file type
  handlers.
- Rewrote wxBitmapButton, wxStaticBitmap to not use Fafa.
- Wrote most of wxTreeCtrl and sample (need wxImageList to implement it
  fully).
- Added back wxRadioBox.
- Tidied up wx_main.cpp, wxApp class, putting PenWin code in
  a separate file.

Alpha 1, 5th April 1997
-----------------------

Generic:

At this point, the following has been achieved:

- A lot, but not all, of the code has been revamped for better
  naming conventions, protection of data members, and use of
  wxString instead of char *.
- Obsolete functionality deleted (e.g. default wxPanel layout,
  old system event system) and code size reduced.
- Class hierarchy changed (see design doc) - base classes such
  as wxbWindow now removed.
- No longer includes windows.h in wxWin headers, by using stand-in
  Windows types where needed e.g. WXHWND.
- PrologIO revised.
- wxScrolledWindow, wxStatusBar and new MDI classes added.
  MDI is now achieved using separate classes, not window styles.
- wxSystemSettings added, and made use of to reflect standard
  Windows settings.
- SetButtonFont/SetLabelFont replaced by SetFont; font and colour
  settings mucho rationalised.
- All windows are now subclassed with the same window proc to make
  event handling far more consistent. Old internal wxWnd and derived
  classes removed.
- API for controls revised, in particular addition of
  wxValidator parameters and removal of labels for some controls.
- 1 validator written: see examples/validate.
- Event table system introduced (see most samples and
  wx_event.cpp/ProcessEvent, wx_event.h). wxEvtHandler
  made more flexible, with Push/PopEventHandler allowing a chain
  of event handlers.
- wxRadioBox removed - will be added back soon.
- Toolbar class hierarchy revised:
  wxToolBarBase
  wxToolBarSimple (= old wxToolBar)
  wxToolBar95 (= old wxButtonBar under Win95)
  wxToolBarMSW (= old wxButtonBar under WIN16/WIN32)
- Constraint system debugged somewhat (sizers now work properly).
- wxFileDialog, wxDirDialog added; other common dialogs now
  have class equivalents. Generic colour and font dialogs
  rewritten to not need obsolete panel layout.
- .wxr resource system partially reinstated, though needs
  an integer ID for controls. Hopefully the resource system
  will be replaced by something better and more efficient
  in the future.
- Device contexts no longer stored with window and accessed
  with GetDC - use wxClientDC, wxPaintDC, wxWindowDC stack
  variables instead.
- wxSlider uses trackbar class under Win95, and wxSL_LABELS flag
  determines whether labels are shown. Other Win95-specific flags
  introduced, e.g. for showing ticks.
- Styles introduced for dealing with 3D effects per window, for
  any window: all Win95 3D effects supported, plus transparent windows.
- Major change to allow 3D effect support without CTL3D, under
  Win95.
- Bitmap versions of button and checkbox separated out into new
  classes, but unimplemented as yet because I intend to remove
  the need for Fafa - it apparently causes GPFs in Win95 OSR 2.
- utils/wxprop classes working (except maybe wxPropertyFormView)
  in preparation for use in Dialog Editor.
- GNU-WIN32 compilation verified (a month or so ago).
