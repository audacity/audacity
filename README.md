[**Audacity**](https://www.audacityteam.org) is an easy-to-use, multi-track audio editor and recorder for Windows, macOS, GNU/Linux and other operating systems. More info can be found on https://www.audacityteam.org

## This repository is currently undergoing major structural change.

We're currently working on Audacity 4, which means an entirely new UI and also refactorings aplenty. As such, the `master` branch is currently not particularly friendly to new contributors. 

## Contributing to Audacity 3.x

It still is possible to submit patches to Audacity 3.x; make sure you branch off `audacity-3` if you choose to do so. Build instructions for 3.x can be found [here](https://github.com/audacity/audacity/blob/release-3.7.0/BUILDING.md). We plan to continue to release patches to Audacity 3 for some time still.

## Contributing to Audacity 4

You can stay updated with our efforts on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/@audacity), [discord](https://discord.gg/audacity) and [our blog](https://audacityteam.org/blog).

If you want to contribute to Audacity 4 anyway: Build instructions for Audacity 4 can be found in [BUILDING.md](https://github.com/audacity/audacity/blob/master/BUILDING.md) and additional developer resources can be found [on Gitbook](https://audacity.gitbook.io/dev).
