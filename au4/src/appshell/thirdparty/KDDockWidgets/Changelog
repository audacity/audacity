* v1.5.0 (unreleased)
 - Install the Python bindings to "site-packages"
 - The Python bindings for Qt6 use the "PyKDDockWidgetsQt6" namespace
 - Co-installable with Qt6
 - Adds support for non-detachable central widget, MainWindowOption_HasCentralWidget. (#225)
 - Fix corrupt layout when restoring old JSON

* v1.4.1 (unreleased)
 -

* v1.4.0 (16 July 2021)
  - No longer supports Qt versions less than 5.12
  - Experimental MDI support. By using MainWindowMDI you can now have "docked" dock widgets
    which are free to be arbitrarily positioned and even overlapped inside the main window.
  - TitleBar's height is now controlled by sizeHint() instead of hardcoded.
    If you haven't overridden TitleBar or just inheriting from TitleBarWidget then there's nothing to do,
    as TitleBarWidget already reimplements sizeHint. If you're inheriting directly from TitleBar then make
    sure to provide a sizeHint.
  - Added MainWindow::closeDockWidgets()
  - Fixed crash in MainWindow::layoutEqually()
  - QtQuick: Added more declarative API
  - FloatingWindow now honours the dockwidget's max-size, if there's a single
    dock widget docked. Tabbed cases are more difficult since QStackedLayout doesn't
    propagate size constraints.
  - Added MainWindowBase::frameCountChanged()
  - Introduced Config::setDropIndicatorsInhibited(), which allows you to disable support
  for drop indicators while dragging.
  - Fixed embedding the main window into a non-kddw main window (#204, #168)
  - Fixed crash with an MFC application
  - Allows to disable translucency via the KDDW_NO_TRANSLUCENCY env var, useful
    in case running on weird Window Managers.
  - Added Flag_ShowButtonsOnTabBarIfTitleBarHidden, which can be used when using Flag_HideTitleBarWhenTabsVisible.
    The close and float buttons will be shown directly in the tab-bar.
  - Fixes persistent central frame being invisible after closing all tabs (#220)
  - Added python bindings for the InitialOption struct (#198)
  - Generate and install camelcase forwarding headers (public, exported classes)
  - Build in Release mode by default (in non-developer situations)

* v1.3.1 (7 June 2021)
  - Improve restoring layout when RestoreOption_RelativeToMainWindow is used (#171)
  - Improved dragging windows across screens in mixed hdpi setups
  - Fixed Flag_NativeTitleBar not hiding the client title bars when restoring (#170)
  - Double clicking a native title bar of a Qt::Tool window will now redock the window (#173)
  - Size of FloatingWindow now accounts for the fact that it's using Flag_NativeTitleBar and
    resizes its content accordingly (#174)
  - Fixed popups on overlayed dock widgets not working
  - Don't restore maximized state when using RestoreOption_RelativeToMainWindow (#184)

* v1.3.0 (8 February 2021)
  - Experimental QtQuick support (#49)
  - Added static DockWidgetBase::byName() (#126)

    KDDockWidgets::InitialVisibilityOption instead

    had manually reordered tabs (#154)
  - Fixed crash when hosting a QQuickWidget (#150)
  - Fixed CMake Visual Studio generator not working
  - Sidebar overlays now maintain their size when toggled (#155)
  - Added DockWidget::setFloatingGeometry() (#144)

* v1.2.1 (6 February 2021)
  - Support for resizing dock widgets when they are in overlay/popup mode (autohide/sidebar feature)
  - Fixed title bar close button enabled state not being restored with Layout saver (#137)
  - Installs a version header (kddockwidgets_version.h) that defines a version string and other useful versioning macros (#138)
  - DockWidgetBase::eventFilter() is protected instead of private (regression vs v1.1) (#148)
    It's recommended that you rebuild your application when updating KDDW, as MSVC encodes private/protected in the name mangling.
  - Fixed WASM build on Windows (#163)
  - Fixed sidebar overlay not getting hidden when clicking on the main window docking area (#157)

* v1.2.0 (17 December 2020)
  - Wayland support
