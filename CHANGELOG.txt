 Major changes

   * Master effects
     A new master channel can now be used to apply effects to all tracks at once.
   * New compressor and limiter
     A new compressor and limiter has been added, replacing the previous versions. Both are realtime-capable.
     A gain reduction history has been added to these effects when they're used as a realtime effect.
     Factory Presets suitable for a wide range of use cases for these effects have been provided by Vladislav Isaev and Marek Iwaszkiewicz, available via the Presets & Settings button.
   * New themes
     Audacity now features new and improved dark and light themes. You can switch between themes via Preferences -> Interface. The theme previously used still is around as the Classic theme, and themes even older than that can be optionally installed as custom themes.
   * Increased performance
     Audacity is now quite a bit snappier than before, especially when working on larger projects and/or larger screens.

 Other changes

   * Added FFmpeg 7 support.
   * You now can paste audio files into Audacity using Ctrl+V.
   * Alternative waveform colors are now themeable by custom themes.

Changes in version 3.5.0

Audacity 3.5 adds cloud saving, beat detection, pitch shifting and more.

 Major changes
   
   * Cloud project saving
     We've introduced a new cloud-saving feature that allows you to save your Audacity projects to audio.com. This allows you to work from any device, share & collaborate with others and restore previous versions if something went wrong.
   * Automatic tempo detection
     Audacity can now automatically detect the tempo of imported loops, and adjust them to be in tempo. 
     Tempo detection is done via both audio analysis and metadata checking. If you want to prepare your loop for automatic tempo detection without relying on audio analysis, both acidizer tempo tags or simply writing "123 bpm" anywhere into the filename work.
     Automatic tempo detection can be turned off via Preferences -> Import/Export.
   * Pitch shifting 
     You now can non-destructively change the pitch of a clip by holding Alt and pressing the Up and Down arrow keys. Alternatively, you can click on the overflow menu (...) and select "Pitch and speed...". When changing the pitch this way, an arrow in the UI indicates how much you've shifted it. 

 Other changes

  Additions
   * Added an option to skip plugin scanning to Preferences -> Effects.
   * Added an overflow menu, as well as speed and pitch indicators to clips.
   * Added subtitle formats for labels. Export to WebVTT and SubRip and import of SubRip files is now supported. (Thanks, Pokechu22 and Larry Bordowitz!)

  Changes
  
   * Reworked the plugin manager. 
   * Improved accessibility. (Thanks, David Bailes!)
   * When zooming in vertically (Ctrl+scroll on the vertical scale), the zeroline now remains centered. Moving the vertical zoom off-center still is possible via Shift+scroll on the vertical scale. 
   * Changed the look of the selection adjust cursors (previously pointing fingers on Windows and macOS, now look like >| everywhere).
   * Changed the timeline options button from a green triangle to a settings gear. From it, you can switch between Beats & Measures or hh:mm:ss timeline rulers, set various preferences regarding to looping, as well as playhead behaviors: "Scroll view to playhead" (previously: "Update display while playing") and "Continuous scrolling" (previously: Pinned Play Head).
   * Improved BSD support. (Thanks, Brad Smith!)
   * macOS: Changed the Audacity.app icon on macOS to fit new design guidelines.
   * Reordered some menus. 
   * Moved OK/Cancel buttons of effects to the bottom.

  Removals

  There have been a number of removals of niche features to simplify the app. This should make the app a bit less overwhelming to use, and also will speed up future development as fewer things need to be considered.
   * Removed the read-only mouse preferences page.
   * Removed Printing options. 
   * Removed Screenshot tool. To make a screenshot, use Win+Shift+S (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+4 (Mac) instead.

   * Removed the "solo=none" preference.
   * Removed timeline tooltips preference.
   * Removed "dragging selection edges" preference.

   * Removed the "Vocal reduction and isolation" effect. As a replacement on Windows and Linux, the Intel OpenVINO plugins work better and on a wider array of content, including mono tracks. The old effect still can be downloaded from https://plugins.audacityteam.org/nyquist-plugins/effect-plugins/filters-and-eq#vocal-reduction-and-isolation

      More information can be found in the announcement post: https://github.com/audacity/audacity/discussions/2142
 
 Removals
    * Removed the Zoom Tool. You can use the zoom buttons or Ctrl+Scroll (macOS: Cmd+Scroll) to zoom instead.
    * The Audacity Manual HTML pages are no longer included in the installation.
       If you require offline access of the manual, you can download it here: https://github.com/audacity/audacity-manual/releases

Changes in version 3.0.5:

 This is a hotfix release that fixes a bug on macOS that could corrupt project files when being opened via cmd+o on languages where the decimal separator wasn't a dot. (#1571)

Changes in version 3.0.4:

 This is a hotfix release. Fixed a bug with envelope points, which could multiply uncontrollably and cause Audacity to crash. In particular:

	#1476: Envelope points are multiplied when using Filter Curve EQ or Graphic EQ
	#1477: Filter Curve EQ will crash if there is an envelope point outside of the selection
	(bug numbers now refer to Github issues and no longer bugzilla bugs)

Changes in version 3.0.3:

 Windows version is now 64-bit
	(Note: 32-bit plug-ins will not work on 64-bit Audacity)
	A 32-bit build of 3.0.3 remains available for download
 Improved default spectrogram colors
 We now provide an official binary for Linux in the form of an AppImage
 Update checking: Audacity can now check to see if there is a newer version available (this is disabled by default on self-compiled builds)
 Error reporting: this is a new dialog where users can choose to send us the details of a serious error
 Multiple bugs fixed, including:

	P1 2754 - Change Tempo & Pitch and Sliding Stretch with selected audio in negative time crash Audacity on windows (error on Mac)
	P1 2772 - Audacity crashes after failing to open corrupt project
	P1 2793 - AUP3 projects fail to compact if project's path contains a single-quote
	P1 2803 - Audacity unresponsive after 'Fit to Height'
	P1 2805 - Audacity fails to export metadata with MP3 files


Changes in version 3.0.2:

 3.0.2 fixes over 30 bugs, mostly conconcerned about the new aup3 files, as well as unicode support. Additionally, the Manage Macros dialog got updated.
 Bug Fixes include
	2708 Nyquist effects fail silently with One hour plus stereo
	2706 Win: Vocal Reduction and Isolation most options fail
	2698 Noise Gate fails silently if "hold" is non-zero
	2720 Cannot open project that's in a read only folder - error message vague

Version 3.0.1 was skipped.

Changes in version 3.0.0:


Improvements

 * Audacity now uses 'aup3' format, with all audio in one file, rather than
   the previous 'pile of file' format.  We are using the SQLite library to
   manageis the contents of this file.  Too many users were previously getting
   caught out by copying part of the project only, when backing up.
 * 'Backup Project' command replaces 'Save Lossless Copy of Project' and 'Save
   Compressed Copy of Project'
 * Added Corsican and Marathi languages.
 * 'Label Sounds' replaces 'Sound Finder' and 'Silence Finder'.
 * Added Import and Export of Macros.
 * Added Attack, Hold and Delay times to Noise Gate.

    * Windows: Queen Mary 1.7.1 Vamp plug-ins crash Audacity on opening
      Plug-in Manager - bug #1244
    * Inconsistent behavior when recording with a selection defined - bug #1839
    * Ctrl + M does not open label for editing - bug #1852

Changes in version 2.2.2:

Improvements

    * Dropout detection
      Dropout detection is controlled from a setting in Recording Preferences
      called "Detect dropouts".
      When this setting is "on" (default setting) Audacity will detect dropouts
      (brief gaps in the recording) and will insert zeroes into the recording
      to keep the other good parts synchronized. These silent spans will make
      the dropouts more obvious, but keep the duration of the recording correct.
      When recording stops, a Warning message box alerts the user and a label track,
      called "Dropouts", is added showing the lost parts, labeled with consecutive numbers.
    * Improved horizontal zooming
      For this release we have improved the way zooming using your mouse wheel
      works and provided a new Zoom Toggle function.
    * Improved vertical zooming
      We have added a context menu to the vertical scale to control vertical zooming
      Previous vertical zooming methods (left-click in the vertical ruler, left-drag
      in the vertical ruler) remain available by selecting "Advanced Vertical Zooming"
      in Track Behaviors Preferences.
    * "Extra" menu
      The "Ext-Bar" and "Ext-Command" menus have been consolidated into the "Extra" menu.
    * Theme tweaks
      The appearance and/or contrast of a few icons has been improved.
    * Easier access to changing key bindings for shortcuts
      For menu commands that are enabled (not grayed-out) if you hold the Shift key
      and click on the sub-menu item, instead of executing the command the Keyboard
      Preferences pop open at the chosen command. You can then change that (or any
      other) shortcut binding.
    * Language selection in Preferences
      Interface Preferences has been upgraded so when selecting languages the proper
      spelling of these languages is shown with accented and special characters.

Bug Fixes

   * Multiple use of "Save As" to the existing open project can result in data
     corruption/loss
   * Crash undoing during record, using Discard button of History window
   * Exporting audio in compressed formats to device with insufficient space produces
     inconsistent/truncated results
   * In Export Multiple, Cancel does not remove the file that is in progress when
     Cancel is chosen
   * Unicode page encodings fixed ( Í¡Â° ÍÊ Í¡Â°)
   * Crash using SBSMS pitch change at low sample rate
   * (Mac) Equalization: "Telephone" curve displays a flat line, no sound on Preview
   * Toolbars: open undocked if previously not shown, unless Reset Toolbars first
   * Analysis effects that create labels should give focus to label track
   * Control value may be out of range when using FloatingPointValidator
   * Analysis effects produce false indication that a label is open for editing
   * Import Uncompressed File Dialog Incorrect Reference to Menu Item
   * Wave Color not grayed out in TCP dropdown menu when in Spectrogram view
   * Hover indication on note track channel toggle appears on all tracks (when
     they rerender)
   * Installer has old logo for 2.2.1 and 2.2.0
   * Un-muting with a single track unnecessarily activates the Solo button
   * Applying chain to file should zoom-to-fit



Changes in version 2.2.1:

Improvements

    * Waveform colorways
      You can optionally change the colorway of the waveforms displayed in your project.
      The setting is per track and not per project so you can have multiple colorways
          in the same project.
    * "Save Other" reverts to "Export" in the File menu
      When we made the menu changes for 2.2.0 we introduced an entry into the File menu
      called "Save Other" which led to a sub-menu for exporting various audio formats.
      Many users were confused by this change and found it hard to find where they could
      export audio from. So for 2.2.1 we have changed that menu entry to be File > Export.

Bug Fixes

   * Release 2.2.1 was mainly a maintenance release.
     Soon after the release of 2.2.0 we discovered some problematical bugs in Audacity:
       Bug #1767 - Opening a second project from Mac's Finder produces a second
         inaccessible instance of Audacity
       Bug #1770 - Crash applying certain chain files
       Bug #1783 - Preview fails when selection extends before zero
       Bug #1787 - Auto-scroll stopped working in 2.2.0

        * Menus Reorganized
        * Extended menu bar provided
        * New keyboard commands for working with clips
    * Help buttons ? in Preferences, Effects, Generators and Analyzers - and
      other places
    * Non-Greying out of effects when no selection (and explanatory dialog
      with help button)
    * Playback of MIDI (and Allegro) files imported into Note Tracks is
      now available.
    * 'Center' option in Selection Toolbar
    * Stem plots
    * Major overhaul to documentation/manual including many new images and
      streamlined text on landing pages for in-program help.

Other Changes

    * Append-record is now the default (use Shift + Record for old behavior,
	to record on a new track)
    * The Esc key now cancels all click-and-drag actions. It also chooses among
      overlapping mouse click targets, which is especially useful in the Multi-Tool.

    * New preferences and preference pages
    * Overhaul of much code:
        * Overhaul of envelope handling code to deal with some anomalies

        * The most serious bug fixed this time round was bug 437 which was
          about what happens when Audacity is recording and runs out of storage.
        * Most of the bugs fixed were more minor, such as bug 463 which was
          about a case in which the numbering on the timeline could display
          incorrect times.



Changes in version 2.1.3:

 * Interface:
   * (macOS) Support for horizontal scroll on Magic Mouse / Trackpad and for
     Trackpad pinch/expand zoom gestures.
   * Pinned option on waveform makes waveform move and recording/playing head
     stay still.

   * Redesigned Meter Toolbars: The default shows separate Record and Playback
      Meters, half-height so they can be wider while docked, in gradient style.
   * A frequency selection can now be made (and spectral edit effects applied
      to those frequencies) when in a spectrogram view. You can also create
      or adjust frequency selections in a new "Spectral Selection Toolbar"
      (available at View > Toolbars).

      (64-bit), Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8 or 8.1.
   * (Windows) Audacity is now compiled using Visual Studio 2013.
   * (Windows) Recording with WASAPI host now includes experimental support
      for physical inputs (up to 24-bit depth) as well as loopback recording.
   * (OS X) 10.10 (Yosemite) is now supported including Apple Audio Units.
   * Please report any issues with WASAPI recording/playback or Yosemite
      to http://www.audacityteam.org/contact/#feedback .
   * (Linux Ubuntu) Under Unity, keyboard shortcuts are not visible in the
     Audacity menus. Keyboard shortcuts are visible if you install the classic
     GNOME Flashback interface or under Unity if you open Audacity with the
     UBUNTU_MENUPROXY=0 environment variable. Audacity compiled from source
     will ship with src/audacity.desktop.in set to UBUNTU_MENUPROXY=0 but it
     will remain up to distributions to use this desktop file.



Changes in version 2.0.6:

 * Interface:
   * Redesigned, searchable Keyboard Preferences with Tree, Name and Key views.
   * Edit Menu: "Cut" and "Delete" are now in the top level of the menu.
   * Transport Menu now includes "Play/Stop" and "Play/Stop and Set Cursor"
      (use Keyboard Preferences to create shortcuts for "Play" and "Stop").
   * Tracks Menu now includes "Mix and Render to New Track".
   * Track Drop-Down Menu now has Move Track To Top and Move Track To Bottom.
   * New right-click menu choice "Delete Label" to remove single labels.
   * "Snap To" now offers choice of snap to the "closest" or "prior" position.
      Note: the previous "Snap To On" keyboard shortcut will no longer work.
   * "Snap To" settings are now independent for each project.

 * Effects:
   * Truncate Silence: redesigned with simpler option "Truncate Detected
      Silence" to shorten to the specified length without compressing silence.
   * VST effects: New "Settings" dialog lets you specify buffer size (for
      faster processing) and enable buffer delay compensation (to prevent
      inserted silence). Compensation may cause a crash in a few plug-ins.
   * VST effects now support standard FXP presets.
   * LV2 effects are now supported on all platforms (textual interface only).

 * Import or export using FFmpeg now requires FFmpeg 1.2 or later (or libav
    0.8 or later). For recommended downloads of recent FFmpeg please visit:
    http://manual.audacityteam.org/o/man/faq_installation_and_plug_ins.html#ffdown .
 * New Tamil translation (largely complete).
 * (Windows) FLAC exports can now exceed 2 GB in size.
 * (OS X) Easier Audacity installation using the DMG: drag the Audacity folder
    to the /Applications shortcut.
 * (OS X) Audacity 2.0.6 will not officially support OS X 10.10 Yosemite when
    released (in particular, Apple Audio Units may not open in Audacity).
 * (Linux) Self-compiled builds of Audacity now search for system LADSPA
    effects in /usr/lib/ladspa.

Bug fixes:

 * Interface:
   * Region Restore did not restore the region after using Preferences.
   * Dragging selections with the keyboard or Selection Toolbar digits
      was very slow.
   * (Windows) Help > About Audacity crashed when run in Magyar language.
   * (OS X) Some full and reduced Menu Bar items were not translated.
   * (OS X and Linux) Fixed various interface crashes.

 * Effects:
   * Reverb and Paulstretch were missing from Chains.
   * Analyze > Contrast could report very inaccurate rms levels.
   * Noise Removal: Attack and decay times were half as long as set.
   * (OS X and Linux) Nyquist effects ran much more slowly than on Windows.

 * Click or drag on the Timeline after Loop Play continued to loop.
 * Transcription Toolbar did not play slower than 0.1x speed.
 * (Linux) Audacity did not build if python 2 was not available.
 * Projects did not reopen correctly if they contained tracks having
   2^31 samples or greater of audio (just over 13.5 hours at 44100 Hz).



Changes in version 2.0.5:

 * Tracks Menu:
   * The separate commands that aligned track start or end with the cursor or
      with selection start are combined into "Cursor/Selection Start" commands.
   * "Align and Move Cursor" renamed to "Move Selection when Aligning".

 * Label Tracks:
   * Labels Editor now allows empty labels to be saved on closing the editor.
   * TAB and SHIFT+TAB when the label track has focus now always move forwards
      or backwards respectively to the nearest label.

 * (Windows) On a very few machines, the Windows WDM-KS low latency audio host
    introduced in Audacity 2.0.4 caused Audacity to hang or the computer to
    crash. WDM-KS has been removed from 2.0.5 until it can be safely enabled.

 * (Windows and OS X) Screen reader improvements for Install VST Effects dialog.

 * (OS X) Audio Unit plug-ins detected by Audacity on launch are now not loaded
    until chosen from the Effect menu. This should speed up launch and avoid
    crashes at launch due to misbehaving Audio Units.

 * (Linux) Update to PortAudio r1910 fixes memory and other bugs under ALSA.

 * (Linux) Applied fix for wxGTK 2.8.12 bug which resulted in loss of Audacity's
    menu bar (or visual corruption under Unity) on Debian-based systems.

 Bug fixes:

 * Shaped dither was corrupted and too loud on all stereo exports except FLAC.

 * Keyboard Preferences: some Edit and Align commands for different sub-menus
    showed the same name.

 * Recordings stopped with "Stop and Set Cursor" shortcut could not be undone.

 * In locales that use comma for decimal separator:
    * Text boxes with slider in Nyquist effects only produced whole numbers
       when using comma to enter a fractional number. Text boxes without
       slider still have this problem.
    * Built-in generators produced silence after running a Nyquist effect.

 * (Windows) When first changing to Windows WASAPI host, the input volume slider
    in Mixer Toolbar was enabled when it should have been permanently disabled.

 * (Windows) On some machines, launching Audacity then recording from the current
    Device Toolbar input would not record until the input was reselected.

 * (OS X) Frequent crashes occurred on importing audio files on some machines.

 * (OS X) Files did not open using Finder "Open with", double-clicking the
    file or dragging the file to the Audacity icon.

 * (Linux 64-bit) Fixed a crash when using Equalization.

 * (Linux) It was not possible to open an effect or other dialog then navigate
    through the dialog using TAB.

 * (Linux) The Play shortcut did not play a read-directly WAV, AIFF or FLAC
    import if the warning for importing uncompressed files appeared.



Changes in version 2.0.4:

 * New "Reverb" effect to replace GVerb, based on the original "Freeverb".
 * New View > Go to Selection Start and Go to Selection End commands.
 * New "Align End to End" command to append existing tracks to each other.
 * Change Tempo now supports fractional BPM.
 * Plot Spectrum now supports FFT sizes up to 65536.
 * WAV files now support "Album Title", "Track Number" and "Genre" LIST INFO
    tags and also support ID3 tags.
 * Handle a bug in older iPods or some OS X applications that cause them to
    refuse AIFF files whose metadata contains an uneven number of characters,
 * (Windows) Added support for "Windows WDM-KS" host which can provide very
    low latencies if you reduce "Audio to Buffer" in Recording Preferences.
 * (Windows Vista and later) You can now record computer playback by choosing
    the new "Windows WASAPI" host in Device Toolbar then a "loopback" input.
 * (Windows and Mac OS X): VST scanning dialog now replaced with a dialog
    for choosing which VST effects to load.
 * (Linux) CTRL + ALT can now be used to smooth samples in Draw Tool.
 * Modules Preferences replaced with a dialog on launch of Audacity
    enabling you to choose which modules to load.

Bug fixes:

 * Keyboard Preferences: Shortcuts for Generators, Effects and Analyzers
    were not exported. All imported shortcut changes were discarded.
 * Equalization curves were corrupted in Graphic EQ mode after switching
    to/from Draw Curves or after	running the effect then reopening it.
 * Change Pitch displayed corrupted values when reducing pitch or editing
    "from" Frequency. Detection was very inaccurate at high sample rates.
 * Bass Boost no longer clips if the track contains 32-bit audio.
 * Auto Duck was excessively slow on older machines.
 * (Windows) Exported MP3 comments tags were not seen by Windows programs.
 * (Windows and OS X) Audacity crashed if you used system quit before
    file import was complete.
 * (Linux) Equalization crashed Audacity if the XML file was corrupted.
 * (Linux) When configuring effect parameters in "Edit Chains", "Preview"
    (not intended to be functional) caused a crash.
 * (Linux) LICENSE.txt and README.txt were wrongly installed in
     /usr/local/share/doc instead of /usr/local/share/doc/audacity/ .
 * Accessibility: ENTER did not toggle selectedness of a label track unless
    a label was selected.
 * Numerous other interface fixes.



Changes in version 2.0.3:

 * The SoX Resampler library (libsoxr) has replaced libresample in
    Audacity releases, offering both higher quality and greater speed. .

 * Time Tracks new features:
   * "Set Range" now changes only the range of the Time Track,
      preserving the pitch/speed set by any existing warp points.
   * Vertical scale added with options for linear and logarithmic
      display and interpolation.
   * Upper and lower speed limits will now be remembered when saving
      and reopening a project in 2.0.3. Warp points in projects saved
      by previous Audacity versions will be correctly restored in 2.0.3.
   * Warp points saved in a 2.0.3 project will be preserved if opened
      in previous versions but playback and display will be incorrect.

 * New effects:
   * Studio Fade Out (uses a filtered "S" curve).
   * Adjustable Fade (accessible effect for creating partial fades
      and adjustable fade shapes).
   * Bass and Treble (replaces Bass Boost).

 * Real sample rates up to 384000 Hz are now supported for playback
    and recording in high resolution devices (the maximum is up to
    192000 Hz for Windows DirectSound host).

 * Labeled Regions in Edit Menu is renamed to "Labeled Audio" and now
    allows splits to be placed at point labels. Labeled audio regions
    that touch without overlapping are treated as separate regions.
    Overlapping labeled audio regions are treated as a single region.

 * Compilation: cmake is required in order to build libsoxr.

 * New Croatian translation of Audacity.

Bug fixes:

 * Crash using Undo whilst time-shifting a track.
 * Crash using Repair if the selection extended into an empty track.
 * Export Multiple didn't prevent export if there was no audio or
    all audio was muted. This allowed export of small invalid files.

 * Time Track:
   * Loop Play of a speeded-up track inserted silence.
   * Playback and rendering was significantly inaccurate, creating
      audible and visual glitches.

 * Accessibility:
   * The mnemonics character "&" was read out by screen readers in
      most of the Preferences choices.
   * NVDA did not read static text in most dialogs. Text can now be
      read by using INSERT + B.
   * JAWS and Window-eyes misread the "Duration" control in Silence
      Generator.
   * Toolbar buttons could not be pressed by ENTER

 * Other interface bug fixes.



Changes in version 2.0.2:

 * Duration controls when generating at a point now default to
    hh:mm:ss + milliseconds format. Selection Toolbar also defaults
    to that format on first installation or resetting preferences.
 * Toolbars visual improvements:
   * "Snap To" in Selection Toolbar now has an explanatory tooltip.
   * Device Toolbar tooltips now display the selected device.
   * Increased default width of Device Toolbar and Meter Toolbar.
 * Improvements and some bug fixes to Nyquist effects, including:
   * Delay (new option to prevent duration change)
   * Sample Data Export (new "L-R on Same Line" layout option)
   * Risset Drum (new "Amplitude" slider).
 * Importing a labels file writes the file name to the name of the
    Label Track, and exporting a labels file offers the name of the
    last Label Track in the project.
 * Removed the "Audio cache" option from Directories Preferences
    due to frequent crash reports. All data operations will now
    be written to disk and not to RAM.
 * Removed the FFmpeg "On-Demand" option from Libraries Preferences
    (this fixes Audacity not building if configured --without-ffmpeg).
 * Compilation: Progress on making the Modules feature mainstream.
    Modules can now be individually enabled and disabled in Preferences.

Bug fixes:

 * Interface:
   * "Retain labels" Interface Preference did not retain labels for
      a region that snapped exactly to both label edges.
   * Projects did not save the track selected state.
   * (OS X, Linux) Timer Record: Interlinking of the Start, End and
      Duration controls was broken.
   * (Windows) JAWS screen-reader did not read the "Draw curves" and
      "Graphic EQ" radio buttons in Equalization correctly.

 * Envelopes and Clips:
   * Exporting (or any render operation) on a track containing
      split lines could create clicks at the split lines.
   * Dragging a clip into another track caused a crash if Sync-Lock
      Tracks was enabled and there was also a label track.

 * Effects and Analysis:
   * Normalize could crash if the track name contained "%".



Changes in version 2.0.1:

 * Shortcuts can now be added in Keyboard Preferences to items in the
    Generate, Effect or Analyze menus, including user-added plug-ins.

 * Nyquist Effect plug-ins can now be added to Chains.

 * New "Paulstretch" effect for extreme slowdown without pitch change.

 * New "Sample Data Export" Analyze effect for exporting a file
    containing amplitude values for each sample in the selection.

 * New Preference (off by default) to import files On-Demand (without
    seek ability) when using the optional FFmpeg library.

 * New Preference (off by default) to retain labels when deleting a
    selection that snaps to the label without extending past it.

 * (Windows installer) New option to reset Preferences on next launch.

 * (Mac) Audacity now has excellent compatibility with the VoiceOver
     screen reader. For details, please see:
     http://manual.audacityteam.org/help/manual/man/accessibility.html#mac .

 * CleanSpeech Mode (no longer supported) will not now be enabled
    even if it was enabled by an earlier version of Audacity.

 * Added Serbian (Latin and Cyrillic) translations.

Bug fixes:

 * Interface:
   * Selection Toolbar: a value for the previous whole second
      displayed if the value was close to a whole second.
   * Finding zero crossings could cause the selection to expand into
      white space at either side of the clip.
   * Clips did not drag to another track if mouse was over a selection.
   * Mixer Board: Rendering four tracks resulted in a redundant Track
      Strip followed by a crash.

 * Imports, Exports and Files:
   * Exporting to WAV or AIFF led to a "Libsndfile says" error or
      corrupted output due to order of metadata in imported files.
   * (Mac) Fixed crashes importing MP3 files on PPC machines.
   * (Linux Ubuntu) .Aup files could not be associated with Audacity
      (they opened in the web browser instead).

 * Effects and Analysis:
   * Normalize: Fixed issues where normalization could be to wrong
      value if applied with DC offset correction, or if applied to
      "read-directly" WAV and AIFF files before On-Demand completed.
   * Sliding Time Scale: fixed an audible discontinuity at the
      beginning of the processed selection; fixed a serious quality
      problem on Linux 64-bit.

 * Other miscellaneous bug fixes, including fix to prevent zooming
    with mouse wheel or ball scrolling the content off-screen.



Changes between version 1.3.14 Beta and 2.0.0:

 * New Interface preference to show the track name in the display (this
    is off by default).
 * Longer default Playback preference for effects preview and preview
    before cut.
 * Restored use of Page Up and Page Down to scroll horizontally.

 Bug fixes:

 * Interface:
   * Fixed playback speed and synchronization problems when dragging
      clips or tracks between tracks having different sample rates.
   * (Windows) Removed a crash risk where shortcuts could be
      used to record or import in one project while importing or
      exporting in another.

 * Imports and Exports:
   * Fixed crashes when changing the sample format of read-directly WAV
      or AIFF files using the Track Drop-Down Menu.
   * Fixed a crash importing MP3 files that had duplicate metadata tags
      (this is a bug in current libsndfile which has been patched in
       Audacity; MP3 files mislabeled as WAV which have duplicate tags
       will still crash Audacity on Linux if Audacity has been compiled
       against an affected version of system libsndfile).
   * Fixed an issue where excessively high or corrupted sample values in
      the audio could corrupt exports from the start of the problem for
      the rest of the file, and could corrupt the rest of the project.
   * (Linux) Fixed Audacity could not be compiled against FFmpeg
      0.7.x and 0.8.x.

 * Effects and Analysis:
   * Fixed crash on launch when using "Ambisonic Decoders (PC)" VST
      plug-ins and other plug-ins that enable additional floating point
      exceptions.
   * Fixed Plot Spectrum background could be transparent on some machines.
   * Bug fixes for Click Track, High Pass, Low Pass and Vocal Remover.
   * Chirp, Tone and Silence generators now remember their settings.

 * Other miscellaneous bug fixes.



Summary of bug fixes and new features between 1.2.6 and 2.0.0:

 * New features: There are dozens of new features in 2.0.0, including:

   * Many effects significantly improved, especially Equalization, Noise
      Removal and Normalize. Vocal Remover now included plus GVerb on
      Windows and Mac. VAMP analysis plug-ins now supported.
   * Improved label tracks with Sync-Lock Tracks feature in the Tracks Menu.
      Multiple clips per track. Tracks and selections can be fully
      manipulated using the keyboard. Many more keyboard shortcuts.
   * New Device Toolbar to manage inputs and outputs. Timer Record feature.
      New Mixer Board view with per-track VU meters.
   * Automatic Crash Recovery in the event of abnormal program termination.
   * Fast "On-Demand" import of WAV/AIFF files if read directly from source.
      FLAC now fully supported. Added support for optional FFmpeg library
      for import/export of AC3/M4A/WMA and import of audio from video files.

   Please visit http://www.audacityteam.org/about/features/ for a full
   list of features in 2.0.0. You can click Help > Manual (in web browser)
   in the program to read more.

 * Bug Fixes:

   * Labels now accept lower case "z".
   * (Windows Vista/7) Pressing Stop after recording could cause a crash.
   * (Mac OS X) Fixed shortcut keys activating when typing in file open or
      save windows.
   * (Mac OS X) Audacity 2.0.0 fully supports Unicode, which fixes an
      issue where Audacity could not work with folders having non-English
      characters in their name.
   * (Linux) Playing existing tracks while recording in mono could cause
      recordings to be distorted or low-pitched.



Changes in version 1.3.14 Beta:

 * Normalize: Faster processing and improved interface. Left-right balance
    in unsplit stereo tracks is now preserved by default, with a checkbox
    option provided to process stereo channels independently.
 * Spectrograms now allow window sizes up to 32768 and frequencies up to
    half the sample rate (the maximum possible).
 * Mix and Render now preserves clip length by not rendering white space
    between time zero and first audio, and preserves audio before time zero.
    To retain silence before the audio starts, generate silence after render.
 * Grouped some Edit Menu items into "Remove Audio" and "Clip Boundaries".
 * CleanSpeech Mode removed from Interface Preferences (it still runs if it
    was enabled in a previous Audacity but can only be turned off there).
 * (OS X) Added support for AudioUnit MusicEffects (but no MIDI support).
 * (Linux) Set the per-user files directory per the program name set in
    configure.
 * (Linux) Changed the default location of the Audacity temporary directory
    to be in /var/tmp not /tmp, so preserving the directory between reboots.

Bug fixes:

 * Interface:
   * Excessive delay occurred when typing into labels in long projects.
   * Last digit of TimeText controls could not be manipulated in some formats.
   * (Windows, OS X) Play and Record shortcuts did not work after clicking in
      Device Toolbar.
   * (OS X, Linux) Crash occurred if Toolbars were reset during playback or
      recording.

 * Imports and Exports:
   * MP2 files were not importable without FFmpeg library or an import rule.
   * Files that could only be imported using FFmpeg imported as noise with
      no error message if FFmpeg was not available.
   * Files containing PCM audio but an incorrect extension (such as MP3)
      caused a freeze.

 * Effects and Analysis:
   * An empty command could be added to a Chain which then displayed a
      Nyquist error message when run.
   * Plot Spectrum didn't preserve signal level if multiple tracks were
      analyzed.

 * Other bug fixes:
   * Audacity has been provisionally fixed so that it can no longer create
      block files longer than the sample format or project format allows,
      and can no longer delete these, which led to data loss. Any overlong
      blocks found are preserved but "orphaned", so will appear as silence.
   * Orphan block files were wrongly reported if cutting or copying to
      the clipboard then reopening the project in the same session.
   * Fixed some crashes and incorrect movement of audio when dragging tracks.
   * (Windows) Data loss is now prevented when encountering a corrupted
      .aup file created in ANSI builds.
   * (Linux) Restore building if USE_PORTMIXER is not defined.



Changes in version 1.3.13 Beta:

 * Control Toolbar renamed to Transport Toolbar.
 * Device Toolbar (on by default) now contains all input and output device
    choices, including host and recording channels. Input/output choices are
    no longer in Mixer Toolbar on Windows XP or some older operating systems.
    New Transport > Rescan Audio Devices menu item to refresh the device list.
 * New "Sync-Lock Tracks" feature (turned on in the Tracks menu) to allow
    groups of audio and/or label tracks to retain synchronisation when the
    track length changes.
 * Equalization: New "Manage Curves" dialog for importing and exporting curves.
 * Noise Removal: New "Sensitivity" slider to adjust the noise threshold, and
    new option to isolate noise.
 * New "Extended Import" Preferences for specifying different importers to
    open specific file extensions.
 * Improved Automatic Crash Recovery with all project changes autosaved.
 * MIDI tracks can be vertically zoomed, time shifted and display bar lines.
    Note: the channel selection buttons are not available in 1.3.13.
 * (Windows and Linux) The window Close button and other system close or
    shutdown commands now quit on closing the last window. File > Close now
    always clears to a new, empty project.
 * (OS X) Simpler installer with top-level "Audacity" folder.

Bug fixes:

 * Interface:
   * Cutting or copying from a track at a given sample rate into a track
      at another rate resulted in speed-changed audio.
   * Generating inside a clip could modify the clip length or create
      spurious clips.
   * Recorded stereo tracks were only half the height of imported or
      generated stereo tracks. Imported stereo files had a "1" appended
      to the track name.
   * Edit > Region Save did not save the cursor position.
   * (Windows) Projects crashed when clicking rapidly inside the interface
      or when applying repeated effects towards the end of audio tracks.
   * (Windows) Some Unicode characters could not be typed into labels,
      or caused a freeze using some input methods.
   * (OS X) Crash when quitting an empty project window, or when closing the
      main project window while a progress dialog was on screen.
   * Numerous other interface fixes including Dependencies dialog,
      Keyboard Preferences and spurious lines drawn on waveform.

 * Imports and Exports:
   * Support added for later versions of the optional FFmpeg library up to
      current FFmpeg HEAD. This should significantly improve FFmpeg support
      on Linux. FFmpeg downloads for Windows and Mac updated to v0.6. This
      fixes mono AAC files importing as stereo, though current 0.5 versions
      of FFmpeg will still work.
   * Both FFmpeg and LAME should now be properly detected even when other
      versions of those libraries exist on the system.
   * New warning (on by default) for importing uncompressed audio files.
      Better error messages when read-directly uncompressed files are missing.
   * Imported ID3v2 metadata tags were removed when exporting without the
      Metadata Editor appearing (for example, when using an export command
      in Chains). Note: As a result of this fix, ID3v1 tags must now be
      written by exporting using (external program) and an installed LAME.
   * U-Law/A-Law files with WAV headers now use the standard 18 byte fmt chunk,
      so should now be recognised by most telephony applications.
   * Variable bit rate MP3s exported using "MP3 Files" were larger than
      necessary because using the bit reservoir was disabled.
   * (OS X) Files imported from iTunes could create invalid characters in the
      .aup project file, causing an error when re-opening the project. Note:
      An error "reference to invalid character number" will still occur if
      re-opening a project created in previous Betas that contains such
      characters. To fix the issue, open a back-up copy of the .aup file in a
      text editor, turn off word wrap, then in the line indicated in the error
      message, remove the string of characters that starts with &# and ends
      with a semi-colon (;).

 * Other bug fixes:
   * Nyquist effects: fixes for crashes, incorrect slider behaviour and better
      support for backslashes, double quotes and Unicode characters.
   * (Windows and OS X) Processing of VST effects was substantially slower than
      in previous versions of Audacity.
   * (OS X 10.5 PPC) A first-time installation of Audacity Beta would hang
      on launch if VST effects were detected.
   * (Linux) Recordings made with the pulse device crashed or stalled when
      using overdub and/or software playthrough.
   * (Linux) Play-at-Speed crashed at 0.08 speed or lower if Audacity was
      configured with libsamplerate.



Changes in version 1.3.12 Beta:

 * A hover tooltip is now provided if the Mixer Toolbar input selector
    cannot control the system slider for the selected input.
 * More intuitive behavior when moving and resizing labels by dragging
 * Support added for importing lists of files (LOF) containing relative
    paths
 * Export Multiple: new option to use a numerical prefix before existing
    label or track names; "Success" dialog now resizable
 * New Equalization preset "Inverse RIAA", with new button to invert
    other curves
 * Timer Record now remembers last scheduled duration
 * Meter Toolbar can now be made much narrower, and so more suitable for
    vertical orientation
 * New Preferences choice for "System" language which is used on first
    run instead of asking user to choose language
 * Warning now provided if WAV/AIFF exports are not successfully
    completed
 * (Linux) Improved icon set in compliance with freedesktop.org
    Icon Theme Specification 0.6

Bug fixes:

 * Imports and Exports:
   * AAC files could not be exported at 48000 Hz
   * When importing multiple native file formats using FFmpeg, all
      files after the first reverted to using the native importer
   * FFmpeg custom export window too large on 800 x 600 resolution
      monitors
   * Projects froze if files imported via On-Demand were no longer
      available
   * (Linux) WAV/AIFF exports were corrupted if overwriting an aliased
      file which had been imported using the command line

 * Labels:
   * Cutting or deleting a region in the waveform and label track did
      not move the labels in advance of the cut
   * Incorrect behavior snapping to labels and boundaries when Snep To
      was enabled
   * Labels can now be reversed if included with the audio selection

 * Other bug fixes:
   * When using non-English languages, Generate effects truncated the
      selected region
   * Mice with high-precision scroll-wheels could cause a crash
   * Changing recording preferences using the Transport menu did
      not update the menu in other open projects
   * (Windows 7) Clicking in a file open or save dialog caused files or
      folders to disappear from the list, and file filtering was broken



Changes in version 1.3.11 Beta:

 * (Windows) Better icon file with higher resolution and transparency
 * New SoundFinder plug-in to label regions of audio between silences, so

Changes in 1.3.0:

   New features
   The new features in Audacity 1.3 have been grouped into the
   following six major categories.

   1. Collapse/Expand Tracks
      In Audacity 1.3, every track has an upward-pointing triangle at
      the bottom of the label area on the left side of the track.

   2. Multiple clips per track
      In Audacity 1.2, there is one audio 'clip' per track. There is
      no easy way to time-shift part of a track without moving the
      rest. In Audacity 1.3, you can split a single track into multiple
      clips. You can move these clips around between different tracks,
      making it easy to construct complex compositions out of hundreds
      of smaller audio samples.

   3. Selection Bar
      In Audacity 1.2, the current selection is contained in a
      status bar at the bottom of the window. In Audacity 1.3,
      this is replaced by a fully functional Selection Bar, which
      displays and controls the current selection (your choice of
      Start and End, or Start and Length), and the current audio
      position. The selection bar is fully editable - just click
      in any field and type to change the current selection precisely.
      In addition, many formatting options allow you to view times in
      different units, such as samples, CD frames, or NTSC video frames.

   4. Improved Label Tracks
      Label Tracks are Audacity's way for you to create markings 3
      and annotations within your project. In Audacity 1.3, Label
      Tracks are much improved, with support for overlapping labels,
      and support for modifying both the left and right edge of the
      label region just by clicking and dragging.

   5. QuickTime and Audio Units on Mac OS X
      On Mac OS X, Audacity can now import and audio file supported
      by Apple's QuickTime technology. This includes .MOV and .MP4
      (AAC) files. Unfortunately encrypted audio files (such as
      those from the iTunes Music Store) cannot be imported directly
      into Audacity - Apple does not allow this to be done easily
      because it would be too easy to circumvent the encryption this way.

      Also on Mac OS X, Audacity now supports Audio Unit plug-ins.
      Audacity searches for Audio Units in the usual location, in the
      system or user's Library folder.

   6. Other features
      Better performance with large projects

      Project integrity check on open

      Transcription toolbar

      Upload

      Batch

      Cut lines

      CleanSpeech



Changes in 1.2.4:

  * The File menu now includes a list of recent files.

  * The "Generate Silence" effect now prompts for a length.

  * Audacity is now built with Vorbis 1.1, which features better encoding
    quality and file compression.

  * Dragging sound files into the Audacity window now works on Mac OS X
    and Linux, as well as Windows.  (Before, it worked only on Windows.)

  * The "View History" window can now discard old undo levels to save disk
    space on Windows.  (This previously worked only on Linux and Mac.)

  * "Preferences" command is now in Edit menu.

  * "Plot Spectrum" command is now in Analyze menu.

  * Opening a project file saved by a later version of Audacity displays
    an intelligent error message.  Also, trying to import a project file
    (instead of open it) displays an intelligent error message.

  * Audacity now compiles in Visual C++ .NET 2003.

  * Other minor bug fixes.

  * New or updated translations: Arabic (ar), Czech (cs), Finnish (fi),
    Hungarian (hu), Japanese (ja), Norwegian (nb), Slovenian (sl),
    Simplified Chinese (zh_CN), Traditional Chinese (zh_TW).



Changes in 1.2.3:

  * Fixed a bug that caused recording to stop or display incorrectly
    after about 50 minutes on some Windows systems.  (This was partly
    fixed in Audacity 1.2.2, but still didn't work on some systems.)

  * The Change Pitch and Change Tempo effects have been upgraded to
    use a new version of the SoundTouch library by Olli Parviainen,
    with better speed and higher quality.

  * libsndfile has been upgraded to version 1.0.11.

  * Fixed a bug that caused the program to run slowly when using the
    Envelope tool.

  * Shift-clicking on a mute or solo button now un-mutes (or un-solos)
    all other tracks.

  * Nyquist plug-ins can now accept strings as input.  Also, a "Debug"
    button has been added to Nyquist effect dialogs, which allows you
    to see all of the output produced by Nyquist, for aid in debugging.

  * When the audio file referenced ("aliased") by an Audacity project is
    missing, Audacity will now always play silence.  Before, Audacity
    would sometimes repeat the most recent audio that was played previously.

  * VU Meters will now always reset when audio I/O has stopped.

  * Fixed a major Mac-only bug that was causing Audacity to crash at seemingly
    random times, but especially during audio playback and recording.

  * New or updated translations: Italian (it), Hungarian (hu),
    Ukrainian (uk), Spanish (es). Polish (pl), Simplified Chinese (zh),
    Norsk-Bokmal (nb), French (fr).



Changes in 1.2.2:

  * VU Meters added for both playback and recording.  Click on
    the recording meter to monitor the input without recording.

  * Export Multiple - new feature that lets you export multiple
    files at once, either by track, or split based on labels.

  * Attempt to automatically correct latency in full-duplex recordings.
    (This does not work perfectly, and is not yet supported on all
    systems.  It will improve in future versions.)

  * Fixed a serious bug that could cause data loss when you save and
    then reload and re-edit an Audacity project containing repeated
    or duplicate data.

  * MP3 tags dialog will only pop up the first time you export as
    MP3; after that it will not pop up again as long as you have
    filled in at least one tag.

  * You can now add a label at the current playback position - in
    the Project menu, with a shortcut of Ctrl+M.

  * Clicking on a label now selects all of the tracks, making it
    easier to use the label track to recall selections.

  * Windows: Fixed a crash in the Time Track "Set Rate" command.

  * Fixed a bug that caused problems with recordings over 45 minutes
    on some Windows systems.

  * Mac OS X: Improved support for the Griffin iMic by fixing a bug
    that was causing it to always record in mono instead of stereo.

  * Added support for Software Playthrough (listen to what you're
    recording while recording it, or while monitoring using a VU
    meter) - this makes it possible, for example, to record using one
    audio device while listening to it play through a separate device.

  * Unix/Linux: Fixed freeze caused by captured mouse when audio
    device hangs.  (Audacity may not respond, but it will no longer
    freeze all of X.)

  * Fixed a cosmetic bug that caused improper waveform display if
    you tried to open an Audacity project saved on a different
    platform (e.g., copying a project from a Mac to a PC).

  * Fixed bug that could cause instability when pasting, splitting,
    or duplicating a label track.

  * You can now change the font of a label track by choosing "Font..."
    from the label track's pop-up menu.

  * Basic printing support has been added.  Currently it scales the
    entire project to fit exactly on one page.  Try printing in
    landscape orientation for best results.

  * Mac OS X and Windows: Audacity ships with a newer version (1.0.1)
    of the Ogg Vorbis encoder.  Vorbis compression will now have higher
    quality and smaller file sizes.

  * Fix a bug that occasionally caused crashes when applying effects
    to split tracks.

  * Zoom In / Zoom Out now properly disable when they're not available.

  * Fixed disk memory leak in Preview

  * Other minor bug fixes and performance improvements.



Changes in 1.2.1:

  * The following translations have been added or updated:  Finnish,
    French, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Norwegian, Polish, Russian.

  * Fix a bug that could cause data to be lost when pasting audio
    from one project into another, after the first project has been
    saved and closed.

  * Fix a possible crash when opening or resizing the Equalization
    window, especially when using large system fonts.

  * Don't allow percentages less than -100% in Change Pitch/Speed/Tempo
    effects (fixes a possible crash).

  * Fix a crash when the temporary directory is not available on startup.

  * Correctly load ID3 tags saved in Audacity project files.

  * On Linux and OS X, store lockfiles in the temp directory instead of
    the user's home directory.  This fixes problems in lab environments
    where users have restricted or network-mounted home directories.

  * Fix a bug that prevented Nyquist effects from running when certain
    regional settings were activated.

  * Fix a bug in the Quick Mix command that could cause old temporary
    files to not be deleted.

  * Linux: Fix endianness problems in playback on PowerPC.

  * Linux: Fix compilation problem in Nyquist on MIPS.

  * Linux: Include a more recent PortAudio v19 snapshot (fixes compilation
    problems when building with the --with-portaudio=v19 option).

  * Two new Nyquist plug-ins: "Cross Fade In" and "Cross Fade Out."

  * Other minor bug-fixes.



Changes in 1.2.0:

  * New cross-fade effects.

  * Fix problem where samples were drawn in the wrong position
    when zoomed all the way in.  This caused the drawing tool
    to move a different sample than the one under the cursor.

  * Don't use id3v2.4 tags, which are not yet supported by
    most players.  (This was fixed in 1.2.0-pre2, but appeared
    again by accident in 1.2.0-pre3.)

  * Correctly display translated messages in the status bar.

  * When the cursor is on-screen, the Zoom In button now zooms
    to the area around the cursor.

  * Mac OS X: Fixed audio problems on the Apple PowerMac G5.

  * Linux/ALSA: Work around a bug in ALSA's OSS emulation that
    caused Audacity's playback cursor to move too quickly.

  * Microsoft Windows: The Audacity source code should now
    compile out of the box on Windows.

  * Many new/updated translations.



Changes in 1.2.0-pre4:

  * Fixed problems that could occur when importing certain
    non-seekable PCM audio files, such as GSM610.

  * Fixed bug that was causing the samples to shift off-screen
    horizontally when zoomed in very far and the track had a
    time-shift offset.

  * Fixed bugs in the new resampler that added noise to resampled
    audio on some systems. If you experienced noise when exporting
    to a WAV, MP3 or OGG file you may have been bitten by this bug.

  * Fixed bug that led to occasional crashes when using the
    time-shift tool in conjunction with high zoom factors.

  * Dithering is now only applied on export when it is really
    necessary (e.g. when converting float samples to 16-bit).

  * Files that only contain mono tracks are now automatically
    exported to stereo files when they contain tracks which are
    panned to the left or the right.

  * The Delete key can now be used to delete the current selection,
    in addition to the Backspace key.

  * Fixed bug where Audacity didn't ask whether to save
    changes if you close the project or exit while recording.

  * Mac OS X: Supports Playthrough (listen to what you're recording
    while recording it) if your hardware device supports it.

  * Mac OS X: Audacity is now a package (you can right-click on
    Audacity.app and select 'Show Package Contents').  Launch time
    has improved significantly.

  * MS Windows: Fixed problem that caused Windows XP to use
    the short name of a file ("TESTFI~1.AUP"), which led to
    problems when the file was later opened again using the
    long file name.

  * MS Windows: Fixed bug that caused file exports to fail
    if the destination directory was the root folder of a
    Windows drive.

  * MS Windows: Audacity's application information which
    is written to the Windows registry now always contains
    the full path to the executable.

  * MS Windows: Fixed problems in trying to set the Windows
    registry as non-admin user, for file-type associations.

  * Make sure the "Save" command is enabled after changing
    gain and pan sliders.

  * Updated translations.  Added translator credits to the
    "About" window in localized versions.



Changes in 1.2.0-pre3:

  * Fixed bug where Export is grayed out when nothing is
    selected.

  * Fixed crash caused by opening Audacity on a computer with
    a high-end sound card with no mixer support.

  * Fixed crash in Import Raw.

  * Fixed New Stereo Track.

  * Cosmetic fixes for Mac OS X.

  * Support for the VST Enabler on Windows added.

  * Fixed crash if you close Audacity while the Preferences
    dialog is open.

    rather than the playthrough level of the recording source.

  * Fixed bug that caused corruption to 16-bit stereo recordings.

  * Fixed bug that caused data loss if you deleted all tracks in
    a saved project and then open a new file into the same window.

  * Added support for alternate audio button order (in Interface
    preferences)

  * Added preliminary support for wxX11

  * Added fully transparent Windows XP icon

  * Fixed crash if you try to record (or play) and no audio
    devices exist, or if the audio device doesn't support the
    mode you selected.

  * Audacity no longer sets the process priority to high while
    recording on Windows.  Users can still do this manually
    using the Task Manager.

  * Fixed bug that caused last ~100 ms of the selection to get
    cut off on Windows.

  * Fixed FFT Filter and Equalization effects dialogs.

  * Fixed bugs in Unix build system (DESTDIR in locale directory,
    choosing libsamplerate instead of libresample)

  * Support for LADSPA plug-ins on Windows added, and
    three open source LADSPA plug-ins ported to Windows
    (GVerb reverb, SC4 compressor, and Hard Limiter)



Changes in 1.2.0-pre2:

  * Online help completed.  The full manual is nearly complete
    and will be posted to the web site for online browsing shortly.

  * Audacity will no longer let you do unsafe editing operations
    while playing or recording.  This eliminates many potential
    crashes.

  * Fixed ability to cancel Quit button.

  * New resampling library, with no restrictions on the maximum or
    minimum rate of resampling.

  * Audacity now supports LADSPA plug-ins on all platforms, and
    supports VST plug-ins through an optional LADSPA plug-in
    called the "VST Enabler", which you can download separately.
    Because of licensing issues, Audacity cannot be distributed
    with VST support built-in.

  * Mac OS X keyboard shortcut problems have been fixed.

  * Mac OS X audio muting problems have been fixed.

  * Mac OS X playback/recording cursor sync problems have been fixed.

  * Silence now displays a straight line again, instead of nothing.

  * Added a vertical ruler to the Waveform dB display.

  * Fixed crash in Change Pitch.
