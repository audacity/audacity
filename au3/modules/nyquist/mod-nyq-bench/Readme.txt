THIS MODULE IS OBSOLETE.

As of Audacity 2.3.2, this module is no longer maintained.
The instructions below are very old and probably incorrect.

Notes from original developer:

Two things first...

1)  This is only an example of a dynamic module.  The interfaces
    it uses WILL change in the future.
2)  The NyqBench effect is just my (Leland Lucius) hairbrained idea and it
    may not produce desired results.

For Mac and Linux user, you must change the AUDACITY_DIR variable
at the top of your Makefile to point to the base of the Audacity
source directory.
