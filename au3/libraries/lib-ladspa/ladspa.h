/* Overview:

   There is a large number of synthesis packages in use or development
   on the Linux platform at this time. This API (`The Linux Audio
   Developer's Simple Plugin API') attempts to give programmers the
   ability to write simple `plugin' audio processors in C/C++ and link
   them dynamically (`plug') into a range of these packages (`hosts').
   It should be possible for any host and any plugin to communicate
   completely through this interface.

   This API is deliberately short and simple. To achieve compatibility
   with a range of promising Linux sound synthesis packages it
   attempts to find the `greatest common divisor' in their logical
   behaviour. Having said this, certain limiting decisions are
   implicit, notably the use of a fixed type (LADSPA_Data) for all
   data transfer and absence of a parameterised `initialisation'
   phase. See below for the LADSPA_Data typedef.

   Plugins are expected to distinguish between control and audio
   data. Plugins have `ports' that are inputs or outputs for audio or
   control data and each plugin is `run' for a `block' corresponding
   to a short time interval measured in samples. Audio data is
   communicated using arrays of LADSPA_Data, allowing a block of audio
   to be processed by the plugin in a single pass. Control data is
   communicated using single LADSPA_Data values. Control data has a
   single value at the start of a call to the `run()' or `run_adding()'
   function, and may be considered to remain this value for its
   duration. The plugin may assume that all its input and output ports
   have been connected to the relevant data location (see the
   `connect_port()' function below) before it is asked to run.

   Plugins will reside in shared object files suitable for dynamic
   linking by dlopen() and family. The file will provide a number of
   `plugin types' that can be used to instantiate actual plugins
   (sometimes known as `plugin instances') that can be connected
   together to perform tasks.

   This API contains very limited error-handling. */

/* Fundamental data type passed in and out of plugin. This data type
   is used to communicate audio samples and control values. It is
   assumed that the plugin will work sensibly given any numeric input
   value although it may have a preferred range (see hints below).

   For audio it is generally assumed that 1.0f is the `0dB' reference
   amplitude and is a `normal' signal level. */

   may cease to work correctly if the host elects to use the same data

   hosts to use the plugin to process audio `in-place.' */

/* Property LADSPA_PROPERTY_HARD_RT_CAPABLE indicates that the plugin
   is capable of running not only in a conventional host but also in a
   `hard real-time' environment. To qualify for this the plugin must
   satisfy all of the following:

   (1) The plugin must not use malloc(), free() or other heap memory
   management within its run() or run_adding() functions. All NEW
   memory used in run() must be managed via the stack. These
   restrictions only apply to the run() function.

   (2) The plugin will not attempt to make use of any library
   functions with the exceptions of functions in the ANSI standard C
   and C maths libraries, which the host is expected to provide.

   (3) The plugin will not access files, devices, pipes, sockets, IPC
   or any other mechanism that might result in process or thread
   blocking.

   (4) The plugin will take an amount of time to execute a run() or
   run_adding() call approximately of form (A+B*SampleCount) where A
   and B depend on the machine and host in use. This amount of time
   may not depend on input signals or plugin state. The host is left
   the responsibility to perform timings to estimate upper bounds for
   A and B. */

/* Plugin Port Range Hints:

   The host may wish to provide a representation of data entering or
   leaving a plugin (e.g. to generate a GUI automatically). To make
   this more meaningful, the plugin should provide `hints' to the host
   describing the usual values taken by the data.

   Note that these are only hints. The host may ignore them and the
   plugin must not assume that data supplied to it is meaningful. If
   the plugin receives invalid input data it is expected to continue
   to run without failure and, where possible, produce a sensible
   output (e.g. a high-pass filter given a negative cutoff frequency
   might switch to an all-pass mode).

   Hints are meaningful for all input and output ports but hints for
   input control ports are expected to be particularly useful.

   More hint information is encapsulated in the
   LADSPA_PortRangeHintDescriptor type which is assembled by ORing
   individual hint types together. Hints may require further
   LowerBound and UpperBound information.

   All the hint information for a particular port is aggregated in the

/* The exact mechanism by which plugins are loaded is host-dependent,
   however all most hosts will need to know is the name of shared
   object file containing the plugin types. To allow multiple hosts to
   share plugin types, hosts may wish to check for environment
   variable LADSPA_PATH. If present, this should contain a
   colon-separated path indicating directories that should be searched
   (in order) when loading plugin types.

   A plugin programmer must include a function called
   "ladspa_descriptor" with the following function prototype within
   the shared object file. This function will have C-style linkage (if
   you are using C++ this is taken care of by the `extern "C"' clause
   at the top of the file).

   A host will find the plugin shared object file by one means or
   another, find the ladspa_descriptor() function, call it, and
   proceed from there.

   Plugin types are accessed by index (not ID) using values from 0
   upwards. Out of range indexes must result in this function
   returning NULL, so the plugin count can be determined by checking
   for the least index that results in NULL being returned. */

const LADSPA_Descriptor * ladspa_descriptor(unsigned long Index);

/* Datatype corresponding to the ladspa_descriptor() function. */
