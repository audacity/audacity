Audacity Test Files for Project Check (DirManager::ProjectFSCK)
Vaughan Johnson
2010-08-10

Currently, DirManager::ProjectFSCK() checks for 4 types of errors. 

These projects will generate those errors (2 types in missing_aliased_and_auf_files.aup). 

Of course, when you open them, if you choose anything but "Close
immediately..." or "Temporarily...", you'll "fix" them and they won't be
tests next time.
