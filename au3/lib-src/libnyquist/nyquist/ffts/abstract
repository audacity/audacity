Subject:     FFT for RISC 2.0
To:          macgifts@sumex-aim.stanford.edu
Enclosure:   FFTs-for-RISC-2.sit

Enclosed is a stuffit archive of version 2.0 of my 'C' source code fft library.

   Very-Fast Fourier Transform routines.  Routines are provided for real and complex
forward and inverse 1d and 2d fourier transforms and 3d complex forward and inverse ffts.
I coded these to optimize execution speed on Risc processors like the PowerPC.
All fft sizes must still be a power of two.
Test programs based on the Numerical Recipes in C routines are provided.
Also included are some simple applications with source code which time the FFTs.
See the enclosed read me file for more information.

Revision version 2.0:
		Rewrote code to rely more on compiler optimization (and be less ugly.)
		Removed restrictions on too small or too large ffts.
		Provided a library extension that manages memory for cosine and bit
reversed counter tables.
		Added 2d and 3d complex and 2d real ffts.
		Speeded routines for data too large to fit in primary cache.
		Changed most testing from Matlab to Numerical Recipes based (because its cheaper.)
		Changed call parameters (watch out.)
Revision version 1.21:
       line 126 of rfftTest.c corrected.
Revisions version 1.2:
       I now store the Nyquest point of the real transform where the 0 for the DC term's
imaginary part used to be.  !! WATCH OUT FOR THIS IF YOU USE rfft !!
       Added the real inverse Fourier transform.

Revisions version 1.1:
       Re-arranged to put fft routines in a shared library and changed source file name to fftlib.c.
       Removed some ugly optimizations that are no longer needed for CodeWarrier.

This code is public domain, do anything you want to with it.
