This directory contains "libnyquist", a library for audio processing
within a host application, which is a derivative of Nyquist, a
standalone interactive program for audio processing.  Libnyquist
includes minor changes to the codebase plus the "nyx" directory
containing the external API and glue code.

Libnyquist was written primarily by Dominic Mazzoni, in cooperation
with Roger Dannenberg.  It is distributed under identical terms
as Nyquist - essentially a BSD-style Nyquist with a nonbinding
request that modifications be sent to the original authors.

If any modifications affect Nyx or Audacity, please send these
modifications to the Audacity developers, otherwise contact
Roger Dannenberg directly.

Refer to nyquist/license.txt for Nyquist licensing details.
