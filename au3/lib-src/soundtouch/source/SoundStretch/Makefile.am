## bin_PROGRAMS is the macro that tells automake the name of the programs to
## install in the bin directory (/usr/local/bin) by default. By setting
## --prefix= at configure time the user can change this (eg: ./configure
## --prefix=/usr will install soundstretch under /usr/bin/soundstretch )
bin_PROGRAMS=soundstretch

noinst_HEADERS=RunParameters.h WavFile.h

# extra files to include in distrubution tarball
EXTRA_DIST=soundstretch.dsp soundstretch.dsw soundstretch.sln soundstretch.vcproj

## for every name listed under bin_PROGRAMS, you have a <prog>_SOURCES. This lists
## all the sources in the current directory that are used to build soundstretch.
soundstretch_SOURCES=main.cpp RunParameters.cpp WavFile.cpp 

## soundstretch_LDADD is a list of extras to pass at link time. All the objects
## created by the above soundstretch_SOURCES are automatically linked in, so here I
## list object files from other directories as well as flags passed to the
## linker.

## linker flags. 
# OP 2011-7-17 Linker flags disabled to prevent stripping symbols by default
