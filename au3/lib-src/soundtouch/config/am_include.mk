## These are common definitions used in all Makefiles
## It is actually included when a makefile.am is coverted to Makefile.in
## by automake, so it's ok to have @MACROS@ that will be set by configure


## INCLUDES is automatically added to CXXFLAGS at compile time. The
## $(top_srcdir) macro is set by configure. It's important to use $(top_srcdir)
## in case a user decides to build in a separate directory from the base package
## directory. Using absolute, or relative paths is a bad idea.
AM_CPPFLAGS=-I$(top_srcdir)/include
