TwoLAME TODO List
=================

- use Exact-width integer types (eg uint16_t)

- Add libresample support to libtwolame (twolame_set_in_samplerate etc.)
- parameter checking in twolame.c using assert
- Create a new twolame.spec (be sure to include twolame.pc)
- quite a lot of duplicated code between twolame_encode_buffer_interleaved
  and twolame_encode_buffer
- sort out changing parameter for twolame_set_VBR_q from FLOAT to int (like LAME)

- better use of verbosity settings

- full options sanity checking/verification in twolame_init_params

- don't allow twolame_set_* after twolame_init_params() has been called

- Fix broken DAB support

- with this VBR mode, we know the bits aren't going to run out, so we can 
  just assign them "greedily".

- VBR_a_bit_allocation() is yet to be written :)

- Add a layer 2 decoder ? mpglib ?

- use 32-bit floats internally where possible
