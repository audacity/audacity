INTRODUCTION
------------

TwoLAME is an optimized MPEG Audio Layer 2 (MP2) encoder. 
It is based heavily on:

- tooLAME by Michael Cheng
- the ISO dist10 code 
- improvement to algorithms as part of the LAME project (lame.sf.net)
- other contributors (see AUTHORS)

TwoLAME should be able to be used as a drop-in replacement for 
LAME (a MPEG Layer 3 encoder). The frontend takes very similar 
command line options to LAME, and the backend library has a very 
similar API to LAME.

MPEG Audio Layer 2 (MP2)
------------------------
(taken from Wikipedia article on MP2)

MP2 (sometimes incorrectly named Musicam) is a short form of MPEG Audio Layer II, 
and it is also used as a file extension for files containing audio data of this 
type. While it has largely been superseded by MP3 for PC and Internet applications, 
it remains a dominant standard for audio broadcasting as part of the DAB digital 
radio and DVB digital television standards. It is also used internally within the 
radio industry, for example in NPR's PRSS Content Depot programming distribution 
system.


INSTALLATION
------------

Standard automake process:

  ./configure
  make
  make install
