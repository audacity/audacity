Suil
====

Suil is a library for loading and wrapping LV2 plugin UIs.
For more information, see <http://drobilla.net/software/suil>.

With Suil, a host written in one supported toolkit can embed a plugin UI
written in a different supported toolkit.  Suil insulates hosts from toolkit
libraries used by plugin UIs.  For example, a Gtk host can embed a Qt UI
without linking against Qt at compile time.
