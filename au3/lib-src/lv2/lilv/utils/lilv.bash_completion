# Bash auto-completion script written for lv2info and lv2jack.
# Could be adapted to any other program that takes an
# LV2 plugin URI as parameter.

# For some reason Bash splits the command line not only at whitespace
# but also at ':' signs before putting the parts into COMP_WORDS.
# Since ':' is used in all URIs, which are what we want to complete,
# we have to put the URI back together before we can complete it
# and then cut off the parts we prepended from the completions.
# It probably breaks in some special cases but for most common uses
# it should work fine.
