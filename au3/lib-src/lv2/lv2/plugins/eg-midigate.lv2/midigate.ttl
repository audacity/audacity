# This plugin has three ports.  There is an audio input and output as before,
# as well as a new AtomPort.  An AtomPort buffer contains an Atom, which is a
# generic container for any type of data.  In this case, we want to receive
# MIDI events, so the (mandatory) +atom:bufferType+ is atom:Sequence, which is
# a series of events with time stamps.
#
# Events themselves are also generic and can contain any type of data, but in
# this case we are only interested in MIDI events.  The (optional)
# +atom:supports+ property describes which event types are supported.  Though
# not required, this information should always be given so the host knows what
# types of event it can expect the plugin to understand.
#
# The (optional) +lv2:designation+ of this port is +lv2:control+, which
# indicates that this is the "main" control port where the host should send
# events it expects to configure the plugin, in this case changing the MIDI
# program.  This is necessary since it is possible to have several MIDI input
# ports, though typically it is best to have one.
