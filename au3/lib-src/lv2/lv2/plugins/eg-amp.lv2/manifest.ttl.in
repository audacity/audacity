# LV2 plugins are installed in a ``bundle'', a directory with a standard
# structure.  Each bundle has a Turtle file named `manifest.ttl` which lists
# the contents of the bundle.
#
# Hosts typically read the manifest of every installed bundle to discover
# plugins on start-up, so it should be as small as possible for performance
# reasons.  Details that are only useful if the host chooses to load the plugin
# are stored in other files and linked to from `manifest.ttl`.
#
# ==== URIs ====
#
# LV2 makes use of URIs as globally-unique identifiers for resources.  For
# example, the ID of the plugin described here is
# `<http://lv2plug.in/plugins/eg-amp>`.  Note that URIs are only used as
# identifiers and don't necessarily imply that something can be accessed at
# that address on the web (though that may be the case).
#
# ==== Namespace Prefixes ====
#
# Turtle files contain many URIs, but prefixes can be defined to improve
# readability.  For example, with the `lv2:` prefix below, `lv2:Plugin` can be
# written instead of `<http://lv2plug.in/ns/lv2core#Plugin>`.

@prefix lv2:  <http://lv2plug.in/ns/lv2core#> .
@prefix rdfs: <http://www.w3.org/2000/01/rdf-schema#> .

# ==== Describing a Plugin ====

# Turtle files contain a set of ``statements'' which describe resources.
# This file contains 3 statements:
# [options="header"]
# |================================================================
# | Subject                             | Predicate    | Object
# | <http://lv2plug.in/plugins/eg-amp>  | a            | lv2:Plugin
# | <http://lv2plug.in/plugins/eg-amp>  | lv2:binary   | <amp.so>
# | <http://lv2plug.in/plugins/eg-amp>  | rdfs:seeAlso | <amp.ttl>
# |================================================================

# Firstly, `<http://lv2plug.in/plugins/eg-amp>` is an LV2 plugin:
<http://lv2plug.in/plugins/eg-amp> a lv2:Plugin .

# The predicate ```a`'' is a Turtle shorthand for `rdf:type`.

# The binary of that plugin can be found at `<amp.ext>`:
<http://lv2plug.in/plugins/eg-amp> lv2:binary <amp@LIB_EXT@> .

# This file is a template; the token `@LIB_EXT@` is replaced by the build
# system with the appropriate extension for the current platform before
# installation.  For example, in the output `manifest.ttl`, the binary would be
# listed as `<amp.so>`.  Relative URIs in manifests are relative to the bundle
# directory, so this refers to a binary with the given name in the same
# directory as this manifest.

# Finally, more information about this plugin can be found in `<amp.ttl>`:
<http://lv2plug.in/plugins/eg-amp> rdfs:seeAlso <amp.ttl> .

# ==== Abbreviation ====
#
# This file shows these statements individually for instructive purposes, but
# the subject `<http://lv2plug.in/plugins/eg-amp>` is repetitive.  Turtle
# allows the semicolon to be used as a delimiter that repeats the previous
# subject.  For example, this manifest would more realistically be written like
# so:

<http://lv2plug.in/plugins/eg-amp>
	a lv2:Plugin ;
	lv2:binary <amp@LIB_EXT@>  ;
	rdfs:seeAlso <amp.ttl> .
