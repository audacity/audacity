<p>A feature to resize output port buffers in LV2_Plugin_Descriptor::run().</p>

<p>To support this feature, the host must pass an LV2_Feature to the plugin's
instantiate method with URI LV2_RESIZE_PORT__resize and a pointer to a
LV2_Resize_Port_Resize structure.  This structure provides a resize_port
function which plugins may use to resize output port buffers as necessary.</p>

<p>Indicates that a port requires at least as much buffer space as the port

as large as some input port (because it will copy from it).  If a port is
asLargeAs several ports, it is asLargeAs the largest such port (not the sum of
those ports' sizes).</p>

<p>The host guarantees that whenever an ObjectPort's run method is called, any
