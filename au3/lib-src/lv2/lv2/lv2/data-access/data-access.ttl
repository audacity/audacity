<p>This extension defines a feature, LV2_Extension_Data_Feature, which provides
access to LV2_Descriptor::extension_data() for plugin UIs or other potentially
remote users of a plugin.</p>

<p>Note that the use of this extension by UIs violates the important principle
of UI/plugin separation, and is potentially a source of many problems.
Accordingly, <strong>use of this extension is highly discouraged</strong>, and
plugins should not expect hosts to support it, since it is often impossible to
do so.</p>

<p>To support this feature the host must pass an LV2_Feature struct to the
instantiate method with URI LV2_DATA_ACCESS_URI and data pointed to an instance
of LV2_Extension_Data_Feature.</p>
