<p>This extension defines a feature which allows plugin UIs to get a direct
handle to an LV2 plugin instance (LV2_Handle), if possible.</p>

<p>Note that the use of this extension by UIs violates the important principle
of UI/plugin separation, and is potentially a source of many problems.
Accordingly, <strong>use of this extension is highly discouraged</strong>, and
plugins should not expect hosts to support it, since it is often impossible to
do so.</p>

<p>To support this feature the host must pass an LV2_Feature struct to the UI
instantiate method with URI LV2_INSTANCE_ACCESS_URI and data pointed directly
to the LV2_Handle of the plugin instance.</p>
