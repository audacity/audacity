<p>This extension defines a simple mechanism for plugins to map URIs to and
from integers, usually for performance reasons (e.g. processing events typed by
URIs in real time).  Typically, plugins map URIs to integers for things they
"understand" at instantiation time, and store those values for use in the audio
thread without doing any string comparison.  This allows for the extensibility
of RDF but with the performance of integers.</p>

<p>This extension is intended as an improved and simplified replacement for the
<a href="../uri-map/uri-map.html">uri-map</a> extension, since the <q>map</q>
context parameter has been found problematic.  This extension is functionally
equivalent to the uri-map extension with a NULL context.  New implementations
are encouraged to use this extension for URI mapping.</p>
