SoX Resampler Library       Copyright (c) 2007-13 robs@users.sourceforge.net

These simple examples show the different ways that an application may
interface with soxr.  Note that real-world applications may also have to
deal with file-formats, codecs, (more sophisticated) dithering, etc., which
are not covered here.

With the library installed, the examples may be built using commands similar
to the following.  On unix-like systems:

    cc 1-single-block.c -lsoxr
    cc 1a-lsr.c -lsoxr-lsr

or, with MSVC on MS-Windows:

    cl 1-single-block.c -I"C:/Program Files/soxr/include" "C:/Program Files/soxr/lib/soxr.lib"
    cl 1a-lsr.c -I"C:/Program Files/soxr/include" "C:/Program Files/soxr/lib/soxr-lsr.lib"

IDEs may hide such commands behind configuration screens and build menus --
where applicable, consult your IDE's user-manual.
