SoX Resampler Library       Copyright (c) 2007-16 robs@users.sourceforge.net

Cmake is the recommended way to configure, build (as either a DLL or a static
library), and install libsoxr for general use on MS-Windows, as on other OSs.

However, building within MS Visual Studio is also possible, as exemplified by
the accompanying files:

 * soxr-config.h       Pre-configured for a modern Win32 system.

 * libsoxr.vcproj      Builds the library as a DLL, per above.

 * libsoxr.sln,        Build an example exe using the above.
   example1.vcproj

The following notes apply to adaptation of these files:

 * For a system without AVX support, set WITH_CR64S to 0 in
   soxr-config.h and exclude the three files ...64s.c from the build.

 * If changing libsoxr.vcproj to build a static library, then also
   remove the preprocessor definition: SOXR_DLL.
