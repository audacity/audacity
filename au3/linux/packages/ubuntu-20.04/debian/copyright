License: CC-BY-3.0
 THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS
 CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS
 PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK
 OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS
 PROHIBITED.
 .
 BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND
 AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS
 LICENSE MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE
 RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS
 AND CONDITIONS.
 .
 1. Definitions
 .
  a "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and
    other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation,
    derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a
    literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes
    cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may
    be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form
    recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that
    constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for
    the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the
    Work is a musical work, performance or phonogram, the
    synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image
    ("synching") will be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of
    this License.
  b "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such
    as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or
    broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed
    in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and
    arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in
    which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along
    with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and
    independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a
    collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be
    considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this
    License.
  c "Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and
    copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or
    other transfer of ownership.
  d "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities
    that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.
  e "Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work,
    the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work
    or if no individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and
    in addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers,
    musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver,
    declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or
    artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a
    phonogram the producer being the person or legal entity who first
    fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the
    case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits the broadcast.
  f "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the
    terms of this License including without limitation any production in
    the literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the
    mode or form of its expression including digital form, such as a
    book, pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or
    other work of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work;
    a choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical
    composition with or without words; a cinematographic work to which
    are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to
    cinematography; a work of drawing, painting, architecture,
    sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which
    are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to
    photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map, plan,
    sketch or three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography,
    architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a
    compilation of data to the extent it is protected as a copyrightable
    work; or a work performed by a variety or circus performer to the
    extent it is not otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.
  g "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this
    License who has not previously violated the terms of this License
    with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission
    from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a
    previous violation.
  h "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the Work
    and to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any
    means or process, including by wire or wireless means or public
    digital performances; to make available to the public Works in such
    a way that members of the public may access these Works from a place
    and at a place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to
    the public by any means or process and the communication to the
    public of the performances of the Work, including by public digital
    performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means
    including signs, sounds or images.
  i "Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means including
    without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of
    fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of
    a protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other
    electronic medium.
 .
 2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce,
 limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from
 limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the
 copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.
 .
 3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
 Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
 perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
 exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
 .
  a to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
    Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
    Collections;
  b to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such
    Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes
    reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify
    that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a
    translation could be marked "The original work was translated from
    English to Spanish," or a modification could indicate "The original
    work has been modified.";
  c to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as
    incorporated in Collections; and,
  d to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
  f For the avoidance of doubt:
    i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions
       in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
       compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor
       reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any
       exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;
    ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in
        which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
        compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives
        the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise
        by You of the rights granted under this License; and,
    iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to
         collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that
         the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that
         administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from
         any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License.
 .
 The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
 known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make
 such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights
 in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not
 expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.
 .
 4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly
    made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
 .
  a You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms
    of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
    Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You
    Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any
    terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the
    ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted
    to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not
    sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to
    this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of
    the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or
    Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective
    technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a
    recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to
    that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a)
    applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does
    not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made
    subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection,
    upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable,
    remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(b),
    as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any
    Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
    Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested.
  b If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations
    or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to
    Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and
    provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i)
    the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if
    supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate
    another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing
    entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in
    Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable
    means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work
    if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if
    any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless
    such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing
    information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b),
    in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the
    Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by
    Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original
    Author"). The credit required by this Section 4 (b) may be
    implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the
    case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will
    appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation
    or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner
    at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing
    authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit
    required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the
    manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this
    License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any
    connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author,
    Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your
    use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written
    permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
    Parties.
  c Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be
    otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute
    or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any
    Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify
    or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would
    be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation.
    Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which
    any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License
    (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion,
    mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to
    the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive
    or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent
    permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to
    reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License
    (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.
 .
 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
 .
 UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR
 OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY
 KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE,
 INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,
 FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF
 LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF
 ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW
 THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO
 YOU.
 .
 6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE
 LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR
 ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES
 ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR
 HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 7. Termination
 .
  a This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
    automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
    Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections
    from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses
    terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full
    compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will
    survive any termination of this License.
  b Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here
    is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the
    Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to
    release the Work under different license terms or to stop
    distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such
    election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other
    license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms
    of this License), and this License will continue in full force and
    effect unless terminated as stated above.
 .
 8. Miscellaneous
 .
  a Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a
    Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the
    Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You
    under this License.
  b Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor
    offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same
    terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this
    License.
  c If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability
    of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further
    action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be
    reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision
    valid and enforceable.
  d No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
    breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in
    writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or
    consent.
  e This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties
    with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
    agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified
    here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that
    may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be
    modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and
    You.
  f The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this
    License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne
    Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as
    amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the
    WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms
    Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on
    July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the
    relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be
    enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the
    implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national
    law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable
    copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this
    License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the
    License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any
    rights under applicable law.

 1. Definitions
 .
  a "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and
    other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation,
    derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a
    literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes
    cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may
    be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form
    recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that
    constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for
    the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the
    Work is a musical work, performance or phonogram, the
    synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image
    ("synching") will be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of
    this License.

    arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in
    which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along
    with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and
    independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a

    License.
  c "Creative Commons Compatible License" means a license that is listed

    from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a
    previous violation.
  j "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the Work
    and to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any
    means or process, including by wire or wireless means or public

 2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce,
 limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from
 limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the
 copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.
 .
 3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
 Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
 perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
 exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
 .
  a to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
    Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
    Collections;
  b to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such
    Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes
    reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify
    that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a
    translation could be marked "The original work was translated from
    English to Spanish," or a modification could indicate "The original
    work has been modified.";
  c to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as
    incorporated in Collections; and,
  d to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
  e For the avoidance of doubt:
    i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions
       in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
       compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor
       reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any
       exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;
    ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in
        which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
        compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives
        the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise
        by You of the rights granted under this License; and,
    iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to
         collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that
         the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that
         administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from
         any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License.
 .
 The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
 known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make
 such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights
 in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not
 expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.
 .
 4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly
 made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
 .
  a You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms
    of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
    Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You
    Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any
    terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the
    ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted
    to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not
    sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to
    this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of
    the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or
    Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective
    technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a
    recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to
    that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a)
    applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does
    not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made
    subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection,
    upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable,
    remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(c),
    as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any
    Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
    Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested.
  b You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under the
    terms of: (i) this License; (ii) a later version of this License
    with the same License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative
    Commons jurisdiction license (either this or a later license
    version) that contains the same License Elements as this License
    (e.g., Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 US)); (iv) a Creative Commons
    Compatible License. If you license the Adaptation under one of the
    licenses mentioned in (iv), you must comply with the terms of that
    license. If you license the Adaptation under the terms of any of the
    licenses mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the "Applicable License"),
    you must comply with the terms of the Applicable License generally
    and the following provisions: (I) You must include a copy of, or the
    URI for, the Applicable License with every copy of each Adaptation
    You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (II) You may not offer or impose
    any terms on the Adaptation that restrict the terms of the
    Applicable License or the ability of the recipient of the Adaptation
    to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of
    the Applicable License; (III) You must keep intact all notices that
    refer to the Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties
    with every copy of the Work as included in the Adaptation You
    Distribute or Publicly Perform; (IV) when You Distribute or Publicly
    Perform the Adaptation, You may not impose any effective
    technological measures on the Adaptation that restrict the ability
    of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to exercise the rights
    granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License.
    This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a
    Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the
    Adaptation itself to be made subject to the terms of the Applicable
    License.
  c If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations
    or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to
    Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and
    provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i)
    the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if
    supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate
    another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing
    entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in
    Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable
    means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work
    if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if
    any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless
    such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing
    information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Ssection 3(b),
    in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the
    Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by
    Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original
    Author"). The credit required by this Section 4(c) may be
    implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the
    case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will
    appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation
    or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner
    at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing
    authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit
    required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the
    manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this
    License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any
    connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author,
    Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your
    use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written
    permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
    Parties.
  d Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be
    otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute
    or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any
    Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify
    or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would
    be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation.
    Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which
    any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License
    (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion,
    mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to
    the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive
    or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent
    permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to
    reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License
    (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.
 .
 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
 .
 UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR
 OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY
 KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE,
 INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,
 FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF
 LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF
 ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW
 THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO
 YOU.
 .
 6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE
 LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR
 ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES
 ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR
 HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 7. Termination
 .
  a This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
    automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
    Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections
    from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses
    terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full
    compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will
    survive any termination of this License.
  b Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here
    is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the
    Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to
    release the Work under different license terms or to stop
    distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such
    election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other
    license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms
    of this License), and this License will continue in full force and
    effect unless terminated as stated above.
 .
 8. Miscellaneous
 .
  a Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a
    Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the
    Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You
    under this License.
  b Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor
    offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same
    terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this
    License.
  c If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability
    of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further
    action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be
    reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision
    valid and enforceable.
  d No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
    breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in
    writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or
    consent.
  e This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties
    with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
    agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified
    here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that
    may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be
    modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and
    You.
  f The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this
    License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne
    Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as
    amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the
    WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms
    Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on
    July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the
    relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be
    enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the
    implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national
    law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable
    copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this
    License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the
    License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any
    rights under applicable law.
