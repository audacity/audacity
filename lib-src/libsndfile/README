This is libsndfile, 1.0.18

libsndfile is a library of C routines for reading and writing
files containing sampled audio data.

The src/ directory contains the source code for library itself.

The doc/ directory contains the libsndfile documentation.

The examples/ directory contains examples of how to write code using
libsndfile.

The tests/ directory contains programs which link against libsndfile
and test its functionality.

The src/GSM610 directory contains code written by Jutta Degener and Carsten
Bormann. Their original code can be found at :
    http://kbs.cs.tu-berlin.de/~jutta/toast.html

The src/G72x directory contains code written and released by Sun Microsystems
under a suitably free license.


LINUX
-----
Whereever possible, you should use the packages supplied by your Linux
distribution.

If you really do need to compile from source it should be as easy as:

		./configure
		make
		make install

Since libsndfile optionally links against libFLAC, libogg and libvorbis, you
will need to install appropriate versions of these libraries before running
configure as above.


UNIX
----
Compile as for Linux.


Win32/Win64
-----------
The default Windows compilers are nowhere near compliant with the 1999 ISO
C Standard and hence not able to compile libsndfile.

Please use the libsndfile binaries available on the libsndfile web site.


MacOSX
------
Building on MacOSX should be the same as building it on any other Unix.
