<h2>
<b>V17 - 10/15/01</b></h2>

<blockquote><b>Unix OSS</b>
<ul>
<li>
Set num channels back to two after device query for ALSA. This fixed a
bug in V16 that sometimes caused a failure when querying for the sample
rates. Thanks Stweart Greenhill.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<h4>
<b>Macintosh Sound Manager</b></h4>

<ul>
<li>
Use NewSndCallBackUPP() for CARBON compatibility.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<h2>
<b>V16 - 9/27/01</b></h2>

<blockquote><b>Added Alpha implementations for ASIO, SGI, and BeOS!</b>
<br>&nbsp;
<li>
CPULoad is now calculated based on the time spent to generate a known number
of frames. This is more accurate than a simple percentage of real-time.
Implemented in pa_unix_oss, pa_win_wmme and pa_win_ds.</li>

<li>
Fix dither and shift for recording PaUInt8 format data.</li>

<li>
Added "patest_maxsines.c" which tests <tt>Pa_GetCPULoad().</tt></li>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<h4>
Windows WMME</h4>

<ul>
<li>
sDevicePtrs now allocated using <tt>GlobalAlloc()</tt>. This prevents a
crash in Pa_Terminate() on Win2000. Thanks Mike Berry for finding this.
Thanks Mike Berry.</li>

<li>
Pass process instead of thread to <tt>SetPriorityClass</tt>(). This fixes
a bug that caused the priority to not be increased. Thanks to Alberto di
Bene for spotting this.</li>
</ul>

<h4>
Windows DirectSound</h4>

<ul>
<li>
Casts for compiling with __MWERKS__ CodeWarrior.</li>
</ul>

<h4>
UNIX OSS</h4>

<ul>
<li>
Derived from Linux OSS implementation.</li>

<li>
Numerous patches from Heiko Purnhagen, Stephen Brandon, etc.</li>

<li>
Improved query mechanism which often bailed out unnecessarily.</li>

<li>
Removed sNumDevices and potential related bugs,</li>

<li>
Use <tt>getenv("PA_MIN_LATENCY_MSEC")</tt> in code to set desired latency.
User can set by entering:</li>

<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <tt>export PA_MIN_LATENCY_MSEC=40</tt></ul>

<h4>
Macintosh Sound Manager</h4>

<ul>
<li>
Pass unused event to WaitNextEvent instead of NULL to prevent Mac OSX crash.
Thanks Dominic Mazzoni.</li>

<br>&nbsp;</ul>

<h2>
<b>V15 - 5/29/01</b></h2>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<b>New Linux OSS Beta</b></li>
</ul>

<h4>
Windows WMME</h4>

<ul>
<li>
&nbsp;sDevicePtrs now allocated based on sizeof(pointer). Was allocating
too much space.</li>

<li>
&nbsp;Check for excessive numbers of channels. Some drivers reported bogus
numbers.</li>

<li>
Apply Mike Berry's changes for CodeWarrior on PC including condition including
of memory.h, and explicit typecasting on memory allocation.</li>
</ul>

<h4>
Macintosh Sound Manager</h4>

<ul>
<li>
ScanInputDevices was setting sDefaultOutputDeviceID instead of sDefaultInputDeviceID.</li>

<li>
Device Scan was crashing for anything other than siBadSoundInDevice, but
some Macs may return other errors! Caused failure to init on some G4s under
OS9.</li>

<li>
Fix TIMEOUT in record mode.</li>

<li>
Change CARBON_COMPATIBLE to TARGET_API_MAC_CARBON</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<h2>
<b>V14 - 2/6/01</b></h2>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
Added implementation for Windows MultiMedia Extensions (WMME) by Ross and
Phil</li>

<li>
Changed Pa_StopStream() so that it waits for the buffers to drain.</li>

<li>
Added Pa_AbortStream() that stops immediately without waiting.</li>

<li>
Added new test: patest_stop.c to test above two mods.</li>

<li>
Fixed Pa_StreamTime() so that it returns current play position instead
of the write position. Added "patest_sync.c" to demo audio/video sync.</li>

<li>
Improved stability of Macintosh implementation. Added timeouts to prevent
hangs.</li>

<li>
Added Pa_GetSampleSize( PaSampleFormat format );</li>

<li>
Changes some "int"s to "long"s so that PA works properly on Macintosh which
often compiles using 16 bit ints.</li>

<li>
Added Implementation Guide</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<h2>
<b>V12 - 1/9/01</b></h2>

<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
Mac now scans for and queries all devices. But it does not yet support
selecting any other than the default device.</li>

<li>
Blocking I/O calls renamed to separate them from the PortAudio API.</li>

<li>
Cleaned up indentation problems with tabs versus spaces.</li>

<li>
Now attempts to correct bogus sample rate info returned from DirectSound
device queries.</li>
</ul>
