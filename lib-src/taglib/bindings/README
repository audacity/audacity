There are a few other people that have done bindings externally that I have
been made aware of.  I have not personally reviewed these bindings, but I'm
listing them here so that those who find them useful are able to find them:

- Ruby - http://www.hakubi.us/ruby-taglib/
- Python - http://namingmuse.berlios.de/
