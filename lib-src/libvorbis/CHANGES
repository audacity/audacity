libvorbis 1.3.3 (2012-02-03) -- "Xiph.Org libVorbis I 20120203 (Omnipresent)"

* vorbis: additional proofing against invalid/malicious 
  streams in decode (see SVN for details).  
* vorbis: fix a memory leak in vorbis_commentheader_out().
* updates, corrections and clarifications in the Vorbis I specification 
  document
* win32: fixed project configuration which referenced two CRT versions 
  in output binaries.
* build warning fixes

libvorbis 1.3.2 (2010-11-01) -- "Xiph.Org libVorbis I 20101101 (Schaufenugget)"

 * vorbis: additional proofing against invalid/malicious 
   streams in floor, residue, and bos/eos packet trimming 
   code (see SVN for details). 
 * vorbis: Added programming documentation tree for the 
   low-level calls
 * vorbisfile: Correct handling of serial numbers array 
   element [0] on non-seekable streams
 * vorbisenc: Back out an [old] AoTuV HF weighting that was 
   first enabled in 1.3.0; there are a few samples where I 
   really don't like the effect it causes.
 * vorbis: return correct timestamp for granule positions 
   with high bit set.
 * vorbisfile: the [undocumented] half-rate decode api made no 
   attempt to keep the pcm offset tracking consistent in seeks. 
   Fix and add a testing mode to seeking_example.c to torture 
   test seeking in halfrate mode.  Also remove requirement that 
   halfrate mode only work with seekable files.
 * vorbisfile:  Fix a chaining bug in raw_seeks where seeking 
   out of the current link would fail due to not 
   reinitializing the decode machinery.  
 * vorbisfile: improve seeking strategy. Reduces the 
   necessary number of seek callbacks in an open or seek 
   operation by well over 2/3.
