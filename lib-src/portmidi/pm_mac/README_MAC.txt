README_MAC.txt for PortMidi
Roger Dannenberg
20 nov 2009

To build PortMidi for Mac OS X, you must install Xcode, and
if you want to build from the command line, you should install
CMake.

CMake can build either Makefiles or Xcode projects, or you
can use the pre-built Xcode project. These approaches are 
described in separate sections below.

==== CLEANING UP ====
You can remove previously built apps, object code, and libraries by
running "cd pm_mac; sh cleanslate.sh"

==== USING CMAKE (AND COMMAND LINE TOOLS) ====

Start in the portmedia/portmidi directory.

make -f pm_mac/Makefile.osx

(Begin note: make will invoke cmake to build a Makefile and then make to
build portmidi. This extra level allows you to correctly build 
both Release and Debug versions. Release is the default, so to get
the Debug version, use:

make -f pm_mac/Makefile.osx configuration=Debug
)

Release version executables and libraries are now in
    portmedia/portmidi/Release

Debug version executables and libraries are created in
    portmedia/portmidi/Debug
The Debug versions are compiled with PM_CHECK_ERRORS which
prints an error message and aborts when an error code is returned
by PortMidi functions. This is useful for small command line 
applications. Otherwise, you should check and handle error returns
in your program.

You can install portmidi as follows:

cd Release; sudo make install

This will install /usr/local/include/{portmidi.h, porttime.h}
and /usr/local/lib/{libportmidi.dylib, libportmidi_s.a, libpmjni.dylib}

You should now make the pmdefaults.app:

make -f pm_mac/Makefile.osx pmdefaults

NOTES: xcode is likely to crash after building pmdefaults, but
       pmdefaults should be OK (it will be in Release)
   Once you get started, you can run make directly in the 
       Debug or Release directories


==== USING XCODE ====

(1) Open portmidi/portmidi.xcodeproj with Xcode and 
build what you need. The simplest thing is to build the
ALL_BUILD target. The default will be to build the Debug
version, but you may want to change this to Release. 

The Debug version is compiled with PM_CHECK_ERRORS, and the
Release version is not. PM_CHECK_ERRORS will print an error
message and exit your program if any error is returned from
a call into PortMidi.

CMake (currently) also creates MinSizRel and RelWithDebInfo
versions, but only because I cannot figure out how to disable
them.

You will probably want the application PmDefaults, which sets
default MIDI In and Out devices for PortMidi. You may also
want to build a Java application using PortMidi. Since I have
not figured out how to use CMake to make an OS X Java application,
use pm_mac/pm_mac.xcodeproj as follows:

(2) open pm_mac/pm_mac.xcodeproj

(3) pm_java/pmjni/portmidi_JportmidiApi.h is needed
by libpmjni.jnilib, the Java native interface library. Since
portmidi_JportmidiApi.h is included with PortMidi, you can skip
to step 4, but if you really want to rebuild everything from 
scratch, build the JPortMidiHeaders project.

(4) If you did not build libpmjni.dylib using portmidi.xcodeproj,
do it now. (It depends on portmidi_JportmidiApi.h, and the 
PmDefaults project depends on libpmjni.dylib.)

(5) Returning to pm_mac.xcodeproj, build the PmDefaults program.

(6) If you wish, copy pm_mac/build/Deployment/PmDefaults.app to
your applications folder.

(7) If you want to install libportmidi.dylib, first make it with 
Xcode, then
    sudo make -f pm_mac/Makefile.osx install
This command will install /usr/local/include/{porttime.h, portmidi.h} 
and /usr/local/lib/libportmidi.dylib
Note that the "install" function of xcode creates portmidi/Release
and does not install the library to /usr/local/lib, so please use
the command line installer.

==== USING CMAKE TO BUILD Xcode PROJECT ====

(1) Install CMake if you do not have it already.

(2) Open portmedia/portmidi/CMakeLists.txt with CMake

(3) Use Configure and Generate buttons

(4) This creates portmedia/portmidi/portmidi.xcodeproj.

(5) Follow the directions above using Xcode to compile
PortMidi.

Notes: 
   (1) You will also use pm_mac/pm_mac.xcodeproj, which
is not generated by CMake.
   (2) The portmidi.xcodeproj created by CMake will have absolute
paths and depend on CMake, so it will not be very portable to other 
machines or even directories. You can cd to pm_mac and run 
clean_up_project.sh to convert pm_mac.xcodeproj to use relative 
paths and to remove the scripts that run CMake. You'll first have 
to modify pm_mac/clean_up_project.awk to contain the particular
absolute path or your portmidi project. Also, this is a pretty simple
and probably fragile hack to make a stand-alone xcode project. I
don't recommend it. Instead, either use CMake all the time, or use
the portmidi.xcodeproj you get with the distribution.
